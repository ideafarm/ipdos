place all uses of NEWdELcLASSb here
this is done primarily to accomodate _IO_ in the new delete definitions, which would refer to "this" pointer if the above lines appeared with the member functions for the varous classes
placing all NEWdELcLASS lines here also makes it a bit easier to define a new class, since wo less source file must be created
this set of NEWdELcLASSb invocations is split into groups because it takes a long time to compile the whole set, which can cause some cpu's to be idle wastefully
