/**/

before writing an entry, i will sleep until all bytes that i want to use have been read
the final blob will be split if necessary so that the last byte of the buffer is used
the napkin is simply a circular buffer of length prefixed blobs
multiple instances of me can write to a napkin, which can be read by a "monitor"
