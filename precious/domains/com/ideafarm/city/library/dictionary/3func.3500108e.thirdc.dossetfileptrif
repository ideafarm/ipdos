  for example, to move the pointer to offset 10, set c2P.c1 = 0x10 and set c2P.c2 = 0
  c1 contains the low order bits
  after evaluation, it will contain the new position of the file pointer
  this is a 64 bit signed value that indicates the number of bytes to move the pointer, relative to the position indicated by flagsP
