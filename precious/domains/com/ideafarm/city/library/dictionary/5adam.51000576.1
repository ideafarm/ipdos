//  1999, my marketing assault on the Internet, and the consequent discovery of "IdeaFarm" by the slimeballs who plagiarized it!
//   that is the origin of the IdeaFarm trademark
//   i vaguely recall that the original inspiration was to mark my software "ideafarmed"
//   so, soon after i let go of the idea of using papyrus, it occured to me to use "ideafarm"
//   we shared the same moral perspective, and it never occured to me that disrespecting the prior use was an option
//   i knew that my mother was correct
//   (my wife was no big fan of ideafarming, for several reasons!)
//   i called my discipline ideafarming, and i attributed to it credit for the reliable and steady flow of ideas that enabled me to complete my very difficult research project in mathematical economics.
//   my idea capturing discipline: during my ph.d. research 1980-1992, i had developed the discipline of always having pen and paper handy, and always jotting down any idea that came to me, even if i was awakened by it, even if i was having sex!
//   i remember expressing my frustration over the prior use of my coveted trademark to my mother, who said that i would just have to come up with a good name that is not already being used
//   oh, rats; papyrus is already being used (by a stationary / paper products retailer)
//   papyrus would be a great name for my electronic book distribution product, which introduced knowledge trees, reinventing writing!
//  papyrus and the origin of the IdeaFarm mark
//  fix: Econosee came before the IdeaFarm " "(tm) mark

        "I have used IdeaFarm " "(tm) to mark the following products:"
        "<P>"
        "  It was time to archive the software and begin another complete rewrite."
        "  From the beginning, IdeaFarm " "(tm) City was envisioned as a software product, as the software system that would give form to this new place in cyberspace."
        "  I saw cyberspace as a newly discovered continent, and I saw myself as a Pilgrim intent on emigrating to that new place in order to build, from scratch, a culture in which I could thrive as an intellectual creative."
        "  IdeaFarm " "(tm) City would be a sovereign \"country\" in cyberspace, a place not defiled by any facet of mainstream culture, including territorial law and government regulation."
        "  That was the genesis of IdeaFarm " "(tm) City."
        "So, with a completed but still buggy product, a product that I now knew to be way too eccentric in its features to be marketed successfully, my goal became to drop out of mainstream culture and wrap myself in an alternative culture that nurtured rather than killed intellectual life."
        "<P>"
        "  I was dismayed to recognize an abundance of evidence all around me of what one author called, in the title to his book, \"The Dumbing of America\"."
        "  Human culture worldwide was becoming, at best, indifferent to, and at worst, hostile to science and to intellectual life and discourse."
        "  But it was at this time that I realized that the market for such products was vanishing."
        "  (In particular, I wanted to fund MY research with revenue from the electronic book that I had just completed plus revenue that the infrastructure would generate for me as other authors used it.)"
        "  From 1992 to 1998, my goal was to create an electronic book infrastructure that would enable scientists like me to fund research as independent businessmen rather than as suckers on the government teat."
        "  From 1980 to 1992 my goal was to complete a very difficult research project in mathematical economics."
        "  It was during this time that my vision for the product changed."
        "  With my attention no longer riveted onto coding challenges, I was able to take another bird's eye view of my business situation."
        "  In 1998, I released a complete rewrite of IdeaFarm " "(tm) Electronic Book Distribution System."
        "  But since my products were built for both OS/2 and Windows, I simply abandoned the OS/2 market, held my nose, and jumped into the Windows cesspoolOld."
        "  In a way, I was, too."
        "  Most of us were destroyed, in business and othewise."
        "  Religously fanatic in our belief in its technical superiority, and loath to be defiled by any contact with that marketing scumbag Bill Gates, we refused to jump the sinking ship."
        "  OS/2 was a disaster for all of us."
        "<P>"
        "  But the archives for comp.os.os2.moderated establish my prior, vigorous, and effective use of the mark in the software product arena."
        "  (When I rail against slimeball marketers, do not think that I am standing on a moral pinnacle!)"
        "  The thousands of subsequent posts in the newsgroup, approved using IdeaFarm (tm) branded automated moderation software, attest to my youthful crassness in getting the IdeaFarm " "(tm) mark to appear in as many posts as possible."
        "  The very first message posted (by me) in comp.os.os2.moderated shows the importance of God in my life and thinking."
        "  (My base library was, from the beginning, written for portability, and my plan was that all IdeaFarm " "(tm) products would be released simultaneously for OS/2 and Windows.)"
        "  My business motive for this involvement was to encourage the then growing OS/2 market, recruit a group of alpha testers (which numbered 22 at its zenith) for my IdeaFarm (tm) Electronic Book Distribution System, support users, and (I admit) develop brand awareness of the IdeaFarm " "(tm) trademark among OS/2 and Windows developers and users."
        "  (I drafted the charter and completed the rfc and voting process, and then organized a team of five moderators.)"
        "  In 1996 I registered the IDEAFARM.COM domain and organized the moderated newsgroup for OS/2, <A HREF=\"http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.os2.moderated/about\">comp.os.os2.moderated</A>."
        "  When the Internet took off in the mid 1990's, I switched to the Internet and continued my interaction with the OS/2 developer and user community there."
        "  (Does Compuserve posess an archive of messages posted in those early days?)"
        "  As user 71732,5561, I was active in the OS/2 groups, promoting my IdeaFarm " "(tm) Electronic Book Distribution System for OS/2 and Windows, one of the few dual port products."
        "  Compuserve was the primary forum for the software industry, sporting scores, perhaps over 100, groups."
        "  In the early 1990's, OS/2 was the NEW THING that was going to sweep the software market."
        "<P>"
        "  These frustrations, combined with the earlier blasphemy against OS/2, led me to literally tell my customer that he had his head up his ass as I quit the contract!"
        "  We were only allowed to \"check out\" little pieces, one at a time, and my interest in the overall structure of the system was received with show stopping suspicion."
        "  Separately, the Unicode retrofit would touch code all over the place, but IBM was not willing to trust us contractors enough to let us become familiar with the code asset as an entity."
        "  Frustrated with this team development, I began to consider bailing out of the contract."
        "  I discussed this with the other contractors, who advised me to just keep quiet; it would take IBM a year to end our contracts."
        "  The scope of work kept expanding as new difficulties became evident, and it became obvious that the project was not feasible within budget."
        "  I was one of three contractors for the Unicode project."
        "  Still a strident OS/2 zealot, I was shocked to be told by a manager at IBM Santa Theresa that no more new software should be written for OS/2."
        "  My next use of the IdeaFarm " "(tm) mark was to be for an engagement by IBM (Santa Theresa Laboratory) for me to enhance their flagship OS/2 database product to support Unicode."
        "<P>"
        "  This complete loss for them of their control software (their baseline archive was an unuseable mess), plus the inability of their hardware engineers to reduce the electronic noise created by those five unshielded computers, killed their company."
        "  I was so sick of the project that I hadn't bothered to make a copy for myself."
        "  They had lost the release package!"
        "  Shortly thereafter, my customer contacted me and asked me to help them with a little problem."
        "  Furious, I completed my assignment shortly afterward, spent a full week putting together a fully documented release package, and bid my customer adieu."
        "  I was very nearly killed when, after working inches away from my development unit for hours, I discovered that a young \"accident on wheels\" engineer had left the metal cover leaning against the machine, nearly within arc'ing distance of the uninsulated high voltage (400V) power contacts for the heat lamp."
        "  The whole project was horrible."
        "  I abandoned the C code that I had inherited, rewriting the comm system from scratch, and I marked it with the IdeaFarm " "(tm) mark."
        "  Cleaning the very buggy baseline code as I went, I developed, using the C language, took over development of a communications subsystem that would allow other robotic machines in a manufacturing cluster to chat with and control this RTP cooker."
        "  While all of this was going on, the software was ramping temperature up and down."
        "  The computers controlled two robot arms, a high voltage heat lamp, and valves through which the cooking chamber was sucked to a vacuum and/or filled with whatever gas the recipe called for."
        "  The system contained five single board computers, each running MS-DOS and connected via serial links."
        "  My primary value added for them was to resurrect the horribly buggy Forth distributed real time control software for that robotic wafer cooker."
        "I next used the mark on custom software written for Peak Systems, Inc., a now defunct manufacturer of a rapid thermal wafer processor."
        "<P>"
        "  It merely establishes due diligence so that later coveters of the trademark cannot claim to have been reasonably unaware of the prior (and continuing) use of the mark by another."
        "  In U.S. trademark law, registration does not establish \"ownership\" or the right to use."
        "  (The oldest of IBM's eight global research laboratories, the <A HREF=\"http://www.almaden.ibm.com/\" TARGET=\"new\">Almaden Research Center</A>, was established in San Jose in 1955.)"
        "  I viewed the California registration as sufficient because Silicon Valley was the world capital, the mecca, for software development."
        "<P>"
        "  Application to the Trademark Registrar at the U.S. Patent Office was not made because I could not afford the much steeper fee."
        "  A copy of the diskette label, which clearly showed the \"IdeaFarm " "(tm)\" with the capitalized 'I' and 'F', was submitted with my application for trademark registration to the Trademark Registrar of the State of California."
        "<P>"
        "  The whole contraption applied a controlled waveform of power to a device supplied by one of Laserscope's vendors, controlled the oscilloscope to obtain output waveform data, and analyzed the waveform to pronounce pass or fail for the device under test."
        "  The title was something like \"IdeaFarm " "(tm) Modulated QSD Tester\", and was graphic software that controled a personal computer equipped with an Analog/Digital I/O card and connected to a Hewlett Packard Programmable Oscilloscope."
        "  My first use of the mark was on a custom software product made to an order by <A HREF=\"http://www.laserscope.com/\" TARGET=\"new\">Laserscope Corporation</A>."
        "I have used the IdeaFarm " "(tm) trademark to mark software products continuously, beginning in 1992."

        "  Even if I died tomorrow and my business disappeared like a soap bubble, these plagiarists have ruined the mark for each other."

        "  They will regret this as the sins of their youth become widely known."
        "  Each of them then went on to put a lot of money and effort at risk by plagiarizing the IdeaFarm " "(tm) mark."
        "  There was a moment when each of these other people decided that I was a runt that they could just be a bully and beat up."
        "  When used to mark a software product, they harm me by selling \"counterfeit\" IdeaFarm " "(tm) software, and they dilute the meaning of the mark to the point of destroying its usefulness in the software market."
        "  When used to mark nonsoftware products and services, they harm me by \"diluting\" the meaning of the mark."
        "<P>"
        "  Others who have chosen to mark their own products with this mark cannot claim to have been ignorant of its prior and current use by me."
        "  This usage history has been visible via both trademark search and, from 1996 onward, by simply viewing the ideafarm.com web site."
        "The history of the IdeaFarm " "(tm) trademark illustrates the dysfunction inherent in societies characterized by selfishness."

        "  Since 1992, I have been easy prey for any bully who came along."
        "  But I am, as business people go, a runt."
        "  I registered this mark in the United States in 1992 and have used it continuously since then to mark my custom and packaged software products."
        "<P>"
        "  The selfish entrepreneur, in contrast, says, \"Fuck the other guy.  I'll use it anyway.  If the need arises, I'll hire a lawyer to beat the crap out of him.  I'm bigger than he is, and tougher; he looks like a wimp.  I want the mark that he is using.  So I'm just gonna take it.\""
        "  The unselfish entrepreneur, upon discovering that his beloved trademark idea is already being used, says, \"I've got to respect that, for the benefit of everyone in the market.  I'll just have to keep working to come up with a good mark that isn't already being used.\""
