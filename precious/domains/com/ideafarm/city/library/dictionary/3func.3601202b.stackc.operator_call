  normally this should be the same pSubtractFP that was used to sink the values into the stack object
 pSubtractFP
  the value to be searched for
 c4P
arguments
after calling this function, stackC::extractF( tinP ) can be used to remove the item that it references
assumes that the stack was loaded with values by "sinking" them, using sinkF
 2 indicates that c4P was found at the position just below the top of the stack
 1 indicates that c4P was found at the top of the stack
evaluates to the slot id of the plate whose value equals c4P
