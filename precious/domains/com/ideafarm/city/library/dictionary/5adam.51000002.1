   changes will be effective as of the next daily update of the IdeaFarm " "(tm) City Knowledge Tree
   if the file contains such a line anywhere, the entire file will be visible
   the "//VISIBLE" line can be anywhere in the file
   if you do not want your definition to be visible, remove the "//VISIBLE" line
   "//VISIBLE" must begin at the beginning of a line, and there must be no other strokes on that line
  "//VISIBLE" indicates that this definition file is to be visible to the world
   "REST" marks the end of the TODO list for this citizen class

   this "}" marks the end of the body of the while statement

   a tock is about 1.3 seconds
   the ether object is being told to sleep for one TOCK
  etThread.osSleepF( tinP , TOCK ) ;
   the ether object is being told to display "t " on its face (on the computer display)
  etThread.strokeF( tinP , T("t ") ) ;
   this "{" marks the beginning of the body of the while statement
  {
    an etherC object becomes "impotent" when it encounters an exceptional situation that it cannot handle
   an etherC object that evaluates to a nonze""ro value is "impotent"; it cannot do any work
     objects of other classes just supervise etherC objects
    etherC objects do all of the actual work
    ether is the name of an etherC object
   ether normally evaluates to ze""ro
   the "--" causes cTocks to be decremented immediately after it is evaluated
   the body of the while statement will be done repeatedly until cTocks contains ze""ro
   this is the beginning of a C++ "while" statement 
  while( !ether && cTocks -- )
   this instruction places the number 10_f into cTocks
   the current size limit is very large (ffffffff_f)
   countT objects can store whole numbers up to a certain size
   the object is named "cTocks"
   this instruction constructs an object of type countT
  countT cTocks = 0x10 ;
   "_9" would be used to indicate base 10
   the "_f" indicates base 16, which is normally omitted since it is implied by default
   "a_f" is the number aye, base 16, which is 10, base 10
   "\r\n" means "carriage return line feed", which is the way to start a new line
   this line instructs the "ether" object to display some text
  etThread.strokeF( tinP , T("hello\r\ni am a simple citizen\r\nmy definition is only a_f lines long\r\ni will quit in about 10_f tocks\r\n\r\n") ) ;
   this example is single threaded; it does not show how to define TASKS
   the TODO list defines thread 1 of the citizen class
   the "to-do" list is like the "main" function of a C++ program
   this line marks the base of the "to-do" list for this citizen class
  TODO
   if you want to write a C++ function, put it here
   this is a comment line
  // PUT FUNCTION DEFINITIONS, IF ANY, HERE
   "example" is the name of the class being defined
   "com/ideafarm" is the domain of the class owner
   "info@id.ideafarm.com" is the email address of the class owner (you)
   the base of each citizen class definition is a "WAKE" line
  WAKEhIDE( info@id.ideafarm.com , com/ideafarm , example )
 each line of the definition is explained here
adams of this class show their face at work for 10 tocks and then go home
   in other words, indentation cannot increase by more than one column at a time
  if a line begins in column N, then the line above it must begin in col 1,2,3,...,N, or N+1
  the first line must begin in column 1
 if indentation is used, several format rules must be satisfied
 do not modify the asterisk lines that delimit these comments
 there must be no blank lines
 beginners should start each comment line in column 1 (the leftmost column)
replace these comment lines with your own comments
