arguments
after calling this function, stackC::extractF( tinP ) can be used to remove the item that it references
  the function must be of type ifc3FT, i.e.: "countT (*ifc3FT)( tinS& tinP , countT& , countT& , countT& )"
   }
   return ((count6S*)c1P)->c1 - ((count6S*)c2P)->c1 ;
   etherC& ether = *(etherC*)pEther ;
   if( !pEther || !c1P || !c2P ) return ;
{
   countT subtractCount6F( countT& pEther , countT& c1P , countT& c2P )
  cast its parameters, as in this example (which, unlike the default subtraction function, only looks at c1)
  pDensityFP should be a function that returns the "density" of the object
   an item will not sink past another item of the same density
  iow, this function preserves ordering
 the new item sinks until the item below it is equally or more dense than it is
like operator << except the new item "sinks" into the stack
