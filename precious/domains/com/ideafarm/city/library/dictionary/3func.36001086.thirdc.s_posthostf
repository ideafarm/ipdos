/**/
*/
  specifies the id of the host whose name is desired, in ifc byte order
    this can be a name known on the Internet, or merely a local name used when installing an operating system on a LAN
   if 0 then the name of the local host is obtained
  can be 0
 nicNameP
  the caller is responsible for deleting this poolOld drop
  after evaluation, this will be nonze and will point to the name that was retrieved
  must be 0
 postP
 tinP
arguments
evaluates to the length of the string obtained
  not really true: 2000.10.07: get "ifc14" rather than "www.ideafarm.com"
 for example, this will obtain the name "www.ideafarm.com" when the associated IP address is specified
if there is no name, postP will remain 0 and impotence will -not- occur
obtains the name of the specified host
