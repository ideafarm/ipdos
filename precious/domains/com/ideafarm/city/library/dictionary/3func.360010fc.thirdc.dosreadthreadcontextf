 osHandleP
  iow, pcWothP points to the "base" of the current stack frame, which in turn points to the base of the prior stack frame, and so on
  *pcWothP contains the value of pcWothP for the previous cpu stack frame
  contains the address of the wo'th countT object pushed onto the cpu's stack for the current stack frame
 pcWothP
  contains the address of the most recently pushed countT object on the cpu's stack
 pcLathP
 tinP
arguments
 for windows nt running on Intel x86, pcLathP <= pcWothP
the relative magnitude depends upon the cpu and on whether the operating system uses the stack frame layout that is "natural" for that cpu
the values returned are guaranteed to be aligned on countT boundaries
the lath item is the most recently pushed item in the current frame
the wo'th item is the base of the current frame
i retrieve the wo'th and lath items in the current stack frame
