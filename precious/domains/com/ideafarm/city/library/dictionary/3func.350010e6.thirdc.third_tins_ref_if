 U: conj: this is in error. correct: if *tinP.pAdamGlobal1->_thirdC_.pThLongLasting is impotent, ...
if the primary thirdC object is impotent, i will always return a reference to a blank, statically allocated tinS, object
 this is to maintain consistency in application coding as well as to maximize speed
it is illegal to use this when passing tinP in as a parameter is an alternative
 for example, use it in the definition of an operator overload
use this to obtain a reference to the tinS, pointer tinP for the current thread, when tinP is not available as a parameter
for maximum speed, i contain no overhead code
