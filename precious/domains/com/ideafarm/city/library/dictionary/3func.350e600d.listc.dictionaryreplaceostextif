 such a value is replaced with the associated id value, which always has the BM_HIGH bit set
 if the input value does not have the BM_HIGH bit set, it is assumed to be a zombie pointer to a null terminated osTextT string
 the string is added to the dictionary if it is not already there
i replace each osTextT* value in pczNameP with the id values of that string in the dictionary
