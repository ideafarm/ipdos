   the string "01" will evaluate to 0x10
   for example, "0x89abc" is illegal
   for example, "89abc" is ok
   sign is not allowed
   ifc order is that the leftmost digit is least significant
   evaluation stops when a nondigit character is encountered
  string consisting of hexadecimal digits [0-9,a-f] in ifc order, followed by other characters
