 jotC could be enhanced to prevent this cost, but this is not done in order to keep things simple and avoid variations in behavior of booksC and its derivative classes
 this costly behavior only occurs when the lath byte of a book is written and then the J() macro is used to access it
this adam demostrates that the next book will be cconstructed and then immediately closed and the written book reopened
