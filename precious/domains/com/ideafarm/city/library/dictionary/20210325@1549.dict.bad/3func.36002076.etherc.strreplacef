  use csttExtraP to specify additional extra strokes
  i always preserve the extra strokes that are present in the source string
  can be 0
 csttExtraP
 psttNewSmallP
   behavior is identical to that of a unit length string containing a null stroke
  this can also be null, or a null length string
  this string can include a null stroke
 psttOldSmallP
   if 0 then psttNewBigP must not be 0
  can be 0
 psttOldBigP
   if 0 then psttOldBigP must not be 0
  can be 0
 psttNewBigP

  strokeS* pstt1d = pstt1o ;
 the following code will do this (it replaces "aa" with "bbbb" in pstt1o, which is reallocated)
if the old string is a string of strings, evaluate this expression separately for each string
if the old string cannot be deallocated then specify it as the second parameter, not the first
 iow, that pointer will change, the memory at the original pointer will be d eleted, and the new memory will contain the result
if psttOldBigP is 0 then psttNewBigP will be replaced
evaluates to the number of replacements made
replaces each occurance of psttOldSmallP
