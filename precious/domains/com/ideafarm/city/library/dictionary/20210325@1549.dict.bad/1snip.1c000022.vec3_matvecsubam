*/
  must point to 3 measureT values for the right vector operand
 pmBP
   col varies most rapidly
   row by row
  must point to ( rowsAP * 3 ) measureT values for the left matrix operand
 pmAP
  must point to the same number of measureT that pmAP points to
 pmCP
arguments
 the right vector will be subtracted from each vector rowwise in the left matrix
 the right vector must have 3 elements
 the left matrix must have 3 cols
i do vector subtraction quickly for vectors in 3 space
