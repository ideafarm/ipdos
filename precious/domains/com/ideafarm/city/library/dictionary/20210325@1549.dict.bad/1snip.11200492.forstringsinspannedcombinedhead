app code MUST delete psttc#idP before using the "continue" or the "break" statements
 if app code moves the pointer to another variable, it must store 0 into psttc#idP
it is legal for the app code (bracketed by me) to delete psttc#idP or to move the pointer to another variable
use me only if soulP was filled using the default piece length CSTTsOULfUSEdEFAULT
