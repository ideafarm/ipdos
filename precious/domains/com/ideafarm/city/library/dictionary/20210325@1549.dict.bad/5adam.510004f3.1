  interpret: if the average relay lifetime is 8 tuck explosions then 001 relays can be handled
  N == 001     RHS == 108
 example from table
 if LHS == RHS then that N is the number of relays that the system can handle before every bang is expected to suffer a collision
 LHS is the number of sequential explosions that can occur during the life of a relay
interpretation
table of RHS of:     L / e = N * log 1+{N}
 the cutoff N is the number of relays above which at least wo relay death is expected during an explosion
table used to calculate the cutoff N in a 2 power explosion system
