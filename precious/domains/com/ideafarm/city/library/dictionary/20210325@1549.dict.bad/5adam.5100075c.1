/**/
*/
 the base os "fc file1 file2" command can then be used to verify that i segmented the input file correctly
 the base os "copy /b in* out" command can be used to concatenate all of the resulting output files
 i write the segments to the same folder
  it can be small or large or huge and the processing proceeds without regard for that
 note that i don't need to worry about the size of the input file
 my input is a small file that i create, but i can be modified to use an input file of any size
i demonstrate how to use fileWindowC to split a large file into segments
