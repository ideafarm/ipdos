arguments
  the domain of this parameter is [0,999]
 msP: the number of complete milliseconds after yP dP hhP mmP ssP since Jesus's conventional time of birth
  the domain of this parameter is [0,59]
 ssP: the number of complete seconds after yP dP hhP mmP since Jesus's conventional time of birth
  the domain of this parameter is [0,59]
 mmP: the number of complete minutes after yP dP hhP since Jesus's conventional time of birth
  the domain of this parameter is [0,23]
 hhP: the number of complete hours after yP dP since Jesus's conventional time of birth
  the domain of this parameter is [0,30]
 dP: the number of complete days after yP mP since Jesus's conventional time of birth
  the domain of this parameter is [0,11]
 mP: the number of complete months after yP since Jesus's conventional time of birth
  the domain of this parameter is unrestricted; any value can be specified
  example: for a time during the year 2010_9, set yP to 2009_9
  set yP = -1 for a time in the last year before our lord
  set yP = 0 for a time in the first year of our lord
 yP: the number of complete years since Jesus's conventional time of birth
all paramters are specified as ze based offsets
a time unit is 1 / ( 256 * 256 * 256 * 256 ) of a day
time1P will be set to the remainder, in time units
time2P will be set to the number of complete days since Jesus's conventional time of birth
 use thirdC::timeFromSecondsIF or thirdC::timeFromMsIF
do not use me to convert elapsed conventional time to elapsed IFC time
i cannot be used to convert
 this function correctly accounts for leap years and leap centuries
calculates city time from conventional calendar time
