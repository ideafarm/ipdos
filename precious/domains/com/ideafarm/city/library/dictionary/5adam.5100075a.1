/**/
*/
 the base os "fc file1 file2" command can then be used to verify that i segmented the input file correctly
 the base os "copy /b in* out" command can be used to concatenate all of the resulting output files
 i write the segments to the same folder
 my input is the large master dll file
i demonstrate how to use fileWindowC to split a large file into segments
