  a good code string has few value constants
  the value of such a code is just the low order byteT value, so is no secret at all!
  a value constant is a value in the range 00ff-ffff
  this tally is the tally of all value constants
 the most significant tally is when minP and maxP are allowed to default
my intended application is to evaluate the level of security achieved in pcP, a string of marriage model encryption codes
i count the number of elements in pcP that satisfy minP and maxP
