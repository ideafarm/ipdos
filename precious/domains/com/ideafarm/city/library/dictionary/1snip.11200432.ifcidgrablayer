  used for grabC instances that must be ct early yet are grabbed later than a level 3 object
 ifcIDgRABlAYER_5BONE
  used for grabC instances used during allocation of a poolC drop
  grabC instances can be assigned to this group during construction
 ifcIDgRABlAYER_4INNER
  reserved for bits grabbed using grabitC instances
  prohibited for grabC instances
 ifcIDgRABlAYER_3MIDDLE
  default group assigned to grabC instances
 ifcIDgRABlAYER_2OUTER
obsolete: ordering begins with "outer" (low) and ends with "inner" (high)
 this is enforced by baseGrabC::registerBegunF
when multiple objects are grabbed by a thread, they must be grabbed in ascending order
 bits grabbed using grabitC instances are not ordered with respect to each other
all grabbable objects are weakly ordered
unidirectional grabbing is enforced to prevent grab loop deadlocking
