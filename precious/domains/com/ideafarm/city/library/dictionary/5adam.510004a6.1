 the purpose of the STATEn symbols is to avoid the need to write state code such as mine when crafting a brand new adam class
 when adding a new state member, replace the STATEn line with code similar to what i have
 use the STATE1-STATE8 symbols to craft the initial definition
instructions
i am an example of what an adam def looks like after it uses a state version higher than 1
