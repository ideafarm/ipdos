  must point to 3 measureT values for the right vector operand
 pmBP
  i modify the values that pmAP points to
   col varies most rapidly
   row by row
  must point to ( rowsAP * 3 ) measureT values for the left matrix operand
 pmAP
arguments
 the right vector will be subtracted from each vector rowwise in the left matrix
 the right vector must have 3 elements
 the left matrix must have 3 cols
i do vector subtraction quickly for vectors in 3 space
