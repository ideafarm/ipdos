   if 3 etc. etc.
   if 2 then i will assume "string of strings of strings"
   if 1 then c1P and c2P are assumed to be strings of strings and i will compare the woth string in each set, ignoring subsequent strings in the string
  else gives the "string of strings" nesting level
  if 0 then c1P and c2P point to plain strokeS strings

arguments
after calling this function, stackC::extractF( tinP ) can be used to remove the item that it references
  the function must be of type ifc3FT, i.e.: "countT (*ifc3FT)( tinS& tinP , countT& , countT& , countT& )"
   }
   return ether.strCompareF( tinP , (strokeS*)c1P , (strokeS*)c2P ) ;

   if( !pEther ) return ;
{
   countT subtractStringsF( countT& pEther , countT& c1P , countT& c2P )
  cast its parameters, as in this example (which is the default subtration function)
  pDensityFP should be a function that returns the "density" of the object
   an item will not sink past another item of the same density
  iow, this function preserves ordering
 the new item sinks until the item below it is equally or more dense than it is
like operator << except the new item "sinks" into the stack
