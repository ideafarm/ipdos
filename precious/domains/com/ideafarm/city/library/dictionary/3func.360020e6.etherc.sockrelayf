arguments
this function writes to sOutP exactly what it reads from sInP, excluding the terminating length value of 0
this function will not return until the peer either writes a length prefix with value 0 or closes its socket
 each record consists of a countT value containing the number of bytes which follow, followed by that many bytes
 both input streams are assumed to consist of a stream of length prefixed byte records
the input streams must be length prefixed
 to close sOutP, you must explicitly send a length prefix with value 0 after all sockRelayF calls that feed into it return
this function will never write a length prefix with value 0 to sOutP
several threads can feed into sOutP simultaneously
reads from sInP and writes to sOutP
