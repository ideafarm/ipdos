  there appears to be a race condition when earDropC is reallocating
 i appear to be thread safe if jotC is used but not thread safe if earDropC is used
thread safety
 this comment is obsoleted by changes to the prolog format (addition of fingerprint and...
  the length prefix is a countT object that is set to the number of bytes that follow for one item
 this is followed by a length prefixed image for each item in the soul
 there is a countT value at the beginning that contains the number of bytes that follow
the layout of the bytes is platform independent
  if another thread pushes to *this, a subsequent call to me will return a new image that contains the newly pushed content
  when all images have been obtained in that way, subsequent calls to me will result in pbP == 0 with *pHandleP unchanged
  call me repeatedly, until i return pbP==0, to obtain all images
  when i return, *pHandleP will point to the position in *pJot immediately following the image at pbP
  if not 0 then must point to a closed handle of type ifcIDtYPEhANDLE_BOOKS
  if jotC is     used then must not be 0
  if jotC is not used then must     be 0
 pHandleP
  if jotC is     used and i am empty then cbP will remain 0
  if jotC is used then cbP will be set to the length of the image pointed to by pbP
  if jotC is not used then cbP will remain 0
  must be 0
 cbP
  if jotC is     used and i am empty then pbP will remain 0
  if jotC is     used then pbP will point to wo of possibly multiple unprefixed images
  if jotC is not used then pbP will point to a prefix that is followed by the image

parameters
  if *this does     use jotC then multiple images exist and the caller must call me repeatedly to obtain all images
  if *this does not use jotC then a single image is returned that includes a prefix
 the layout of the returned information differs according to whether *this uses a jotC backing object
i return the backing image(s) for *this
