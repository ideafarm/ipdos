*/
  this parameter is called "costaP" rather than "costP" to indicate that the value includes the null terminator
  after evaluation, will contain the number of accessible bytes needed to store the full value including the null terminator
  else costaP must be the number of accessible bytes pointed to by postP
  if postP is 0 then costaP must be 0
 costaP
  if costaP is >= the number of osTextT objects needed to store the value, including the null terminator, then the value will be written to postP
  if 0 then costaP must also be 0
  can be 0
