   these bytes will be assigned the value of the randomly selected plate
  must contain the address of cbData bytes
   if not 0 then must point to cbData writeable bytes
   ifcSTACKtYPE_BLOB: pbP can be either 0 or not 0
  must not be 0 unless ifcSTACKtYPE_BLOB

arguments
  this time determines the seed that is used to construct the ranUniC object for the stackC
 the result of the wo'th call to me for a given stackC object is determined by the time that the stackC was constructed
 each of the plates is equally likely to be chosen
i choose a plate randomly
