    this example specifies that the memory must be exactly large enough to hold 0x1000 countT objects
   example: 0x1000 * sizeof( countT )
  specify the number of bytes desired
  must not be 0
 cbP
   ether.memOpenF( tinP , pva , 8 ) ;
   ZE( voidT* , pva ) ;
   to use this memory, pva must be cast to a type such as byteT* or countT*
   this example allocates 8 bytes
  example 3
   ether.memOpenF( tinP , (voidT*&)pca , 8 * sizeof( countT ) ) ;
   ZE( countT* , pca ) ;
   this example allocates room for 8 countT objects
  example 2
   ether.memOpenF( tinP , (voidT*&)pba , 8 ) ;
   ZE( byteT* , pba ) ;
   this example allocates 8 bytes
  example 1
  must be 0
