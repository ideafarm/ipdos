fuck Microsoft and Gates and Ballmer and all of their dumb ass minions
in order to dynamically manage locked virtual memory, these "hints" must therefore be moved out of the way
even though these hints are for all practical purposes ignored, they are imposed as limits to the amount of virtual memory that can be locked
this is needed because MS Windows is such a piece of shit
i raise the base operating system working set size hints
