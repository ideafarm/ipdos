apartment id values that are negative refer to locations in the poolOld header
an ap_artmentOldC object that is constructed with a null pointer or a null apartment id will evaluate to a null pointer or a null apartment id
the byte at the beginning of the poolOld does not have an apartment id
a null apartment id indicates "no apartment"
 ida == (byteT*)pv - (byteT*)poolOld
the apartment id of a location is that location's offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the poolOld
 using apartment id numbers, a process on the local host can refer to a given location in the poolOld by using a value that is identical for all processes
 for some operating systems, including MS Windows, processes attaching to a shared memory block do not all see that block as having the same address
 the address that a process uses to refer to a location in the poolOld depends upon the address range that the operating system assigns for use by the process to refer to the shared memory block in the poolOld
unlike pointers, which are valid only for the local process, apartment id numbers can be used by any process on the local host to refer to a location in the IFC memory poolOld for that host
uses the primary poolOld
use this class to work with apartment id numbers in (interprocess pointers into) the poolOld
