/**/

*/
 it is illegal for c1P and c2P to not be of exactly the same type or class or not be of size sizeof( countT )
 for speed, there is no error checking
  if c1P is a pointer then c2P must be a pointer to the same type or class of object
  like c1P
 c2P
   example: a pointer to any kind of object
   example: countT object
  must evaluate to an assignable expression of size sizeof( countT )
 c1P
parameters
i exchange the value of c1P with c2P
