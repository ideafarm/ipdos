arguments
 in general, the returned value is meaningful only if the strokes are pairwise of the same caste
only idAdam is inspected; the other members of strokeS are ignored
 if one of the strings is exhausted without finding a difference, evaluates to the difference in length of the two strings
 evaluates to the difference within the first pair of distinct strokes
evaluates to a positive number iff pstt1P is "greater than" pstt2P
