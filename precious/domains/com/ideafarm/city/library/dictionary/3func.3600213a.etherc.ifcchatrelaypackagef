*/
   this is because firewalls will break applications that set bDirectP
  setting bDirectP is bad style unless performance considerations require it
  if 1 then a receiving chat server will relay the payload directly to idPortP of nicNameP
  if 0 then a receiving chat server will relay to a remote chat server unless nicNameP is local
  normally should be 0 unless there is definitely no firewall blocking direct access to idPortP of nicNameP
  can be 0 or 1
 bDirectP
  normally is 0
   if 0 and idAdamP is not 0 then a cell will be chosen randomly by the chat server
   if 0 and idPortP is not 0 then the local host is implied
  can be 0
 nicNameP
  normally is 0 unless idAdamP is 0
  can be 0
 idPortP
    the actual elapsed time will also include time spent establishing the partial connection spline and then unwinding it
   a calculation based on this value will underestimate the time that will elapse before timeout
   the standard sleep interval between tries is TUCK * 0x40
  specify a value greater than 1 if the application wants to imply a timeout value for the establishment of the connection spline
  specify 1 if the application wants to see a failure event if the entire connection spline cannot be established immediately
  specify 0 if the application wants to block until the entire connection spline is in place
  all chat relay servers will use this value when connecting upward as the connection spline is established
  can be 0
 cTriesP
   this is not currently enforced, but might be enforced in the future
  must not contain CRLF "\r\n" or other control characters
  must not be of length 0
  must not be 0
    use as much length as you need in order to include all relevant information
   completeness is more important than conciseness
   for some reporting purposes a truncation of this value might, and may, be used
  although length is not currently limited, please be concise and state the most important information wo'th
  the value of this field is used to mark log entries to assist in tracking and debugging the progress and completion of related relay chat sessions
  specify a meaningful, specific, and thoughtful comment to communicate the purpose, objective, and identity of this particular relay chat session
 psttOldCommentP
  normally is not ze
  can be 0 unless idPortP is also 0
 idAdamP
  normally will not be empty
  can be empty
 sSmallOutP
  must be empty
 sBigOutP
 tinP
arguments
 this is because this creates multiple virtual circuits between the same oo hosts
it is bad style to write sBigOutP directly to a remote chat server unless performance considerations require it
normally sBigOutP should be written to the local chat server
after i return, sBigOutP will be ready to write to the local (or a remote) ifcCHAT port server
i do not use sockets
my only function is to fill sBigOutP
i package sSmallOutP so that it will be carried via relay to a local or remote adam who is listening for chat connections
