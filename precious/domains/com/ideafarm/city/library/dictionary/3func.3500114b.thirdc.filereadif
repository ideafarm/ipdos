  normal usage is to call me with !cbP to obtain the file size and then to call me again to obtain the data
  will be set to the number of bytes written to the bytes at pbP
   if 0 then no data will be placed into pbP
  can be 0
 cbP
  points to bytes that will receive the image of the file
  must not be 0 unles cbP is also 0
 pbP
 tinP
arguments
i evaluate to the size of the file (number of bytes available)
