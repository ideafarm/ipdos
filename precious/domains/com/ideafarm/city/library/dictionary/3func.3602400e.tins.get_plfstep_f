  set it to sizeof tinP.monitor.pLFnest + 1 unless you are only interested in looking up a few levels
  1 will work, but the caller will only get the null terminator
  must be an odd value
 ccP
  i will terminate the values that i write with a ze value
  i will write the call nest TAG( TAGiDnULL ) values into pcP until at most ccP-1 values have been written
  i do not care what the contents of these objects is
  must point to ccP countT objects
 pcP
  will be set if impotence occurs
  must be 0
