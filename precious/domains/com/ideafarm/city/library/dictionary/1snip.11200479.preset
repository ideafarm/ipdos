#define PrESET(pvP) { *(countT*)&(pvP) &= ~BM_HIGH ; }

/*1*//*PrESET(pvP)*//*1*/

//A:ASSUME: THE HIGH BIT IS NEVER SET IN A POINTER VALUE (THIS IS TRUE FOR WIN32, WHICH RESERVES THE TOP HALF OF THE ADDRESS SPACE FOR SYSTEM USE)

/**/

 i exist to eliminate the need for complex casting and to make the code self documenting
 but it is bad style to use me to set the high bit when pvP is not a reference to a pointer
 i will compile for nonpointer references pvP
use me only for pointers
code that uses me is probably using the high bit for some application purpose
i reset the high bit in a pointer
