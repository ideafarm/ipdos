 support for the following flags might not be present, or might be removed in the future
   should do some benchmarking to see how much difference various optimizations make
   having a "what you see is what you get" character of the environment is good
   the optimizations that correct poor code style should not be done
   some optimizations such as instruction reordering for the cpu pipeline should be done
  stylized facts
 U: decide whether to allow the compiler to optimize or to require the craftsman to craft code "properly"
some of these flags are not currently supported
