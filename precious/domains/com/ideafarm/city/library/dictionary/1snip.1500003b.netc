each communication between hosts is speedy, unreliable, and limited in size to ifcCBdATAGRAMmAX, including overhead
this instance provides the interface for that network to all processes on the host
on a given host, exactly one instance should be constructed for each idPort network that the host is to participate in
this class is based on viewing the Internet as a collection of separate networks, each associated with a particular idPort value
