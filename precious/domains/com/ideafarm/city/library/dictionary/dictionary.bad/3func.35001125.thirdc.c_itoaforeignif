  high order '0' digits, excluding the units digit, will be replaced with this value

 ostPadP
 valueP
   the number will be in foreign format with high ze's
  will be set to base 16_ digits representing the unsigned value valueP
  caller should normally allocate 9 bytes, and initialize the 9th byte to 0
  must point to at least 8 bytes of storage
