    code notes
/*

/**/
*/
i am also used by the exception handler (defined in thirdC)
  example: WM_MOUSEFIRST WM_MOUSEMOVE
  in such cases, the stack chain is very short and does not contain the tls for tmWindowsF
 this is necessary because winMessageHandlerF is sometimes called from an interrupt handler (conjecture)
 when pTinF is called within winMessageHandlerF, it encounters the location fingerprint, extracts ebp, and continues its search at the new location
 tmWindowsF puts a tlsStackFrameLocationS onto its stack and then uses me to set ebp to a value from which pTinF can find the tls for tmWindowsF
it is illegal to refer to this symbol except on the tmWindowsF thread
i obtain a reference to a tlsStackFrameLocationS::ebp field by walking up the thread stack until i find the expected fingerprint
