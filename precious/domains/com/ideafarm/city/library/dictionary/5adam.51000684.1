   re countT rather than wo countT is required to store the handle for each jot
   individual jots cannot be deallocated; they occupy space until the entire booksC instance is destroyed   
  minus
   random access is at near memory access speed except when the wrong book is in memory
   sequential access is at near memory access speed
   each individual written jot is randomly accessible using a small (re countT) handle
   writing and reading occurs at nearly memory access speed
   unlike poolC, there are no wasted bytes and no overhead bytes
   capacity is not limited to the address space; it is only limited by the capacity of the hard disk volume
  plus
 features
a booksC instance can be used as an in memory store that combines the best features of a pool of memory with the best features of a disk file
