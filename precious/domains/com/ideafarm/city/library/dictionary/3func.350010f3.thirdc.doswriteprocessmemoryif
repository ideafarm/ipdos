 pbP
  must not be 0
 osPidP
  must point to cbP bytes that process osPidP has write access to
  must not be 0
 pvToP
  will be set to 0 if the requested memory is not accessible for read access
  after i return, will normally be 1
  if 1 then will be set to 0 or 1 and impotence -will- occur if the locations cannot be read
  if 0 then will be set to 0 or 1 and impotence will not occur if the locations cannot be read
  can be 0 or not 0
 bOkP
 tinP
arguments
 the impotence behavior depends on bOkP
impotence might or might not be caused by inability to read
