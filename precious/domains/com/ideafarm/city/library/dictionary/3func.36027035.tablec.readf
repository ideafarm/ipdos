   in this case, i will silently do nothing

 cTriesP
  this box is read nondestructively, using etherC::boxGetShadowF
  the name of the box from which data for the table is to be read
 psttP
  the caller is responsible for deleting these stacks

arguments
i can either contain no rows or already contain rows
i must be set up and ready to accept new rows
evaluates to the number of bytes read from the file
 no information about the table, other than the number of rows and columns, is read
 loads each set of coinstantiated objects in the file into me
 will become impotent if the number of columns does not match my cCols
 the numbers of rows and of columns are read
reads data into me from the specified box
