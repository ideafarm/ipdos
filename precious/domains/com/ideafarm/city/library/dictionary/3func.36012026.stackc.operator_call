  normally this should be the same pSubtractFP that was used to sink the values into the stack object
  can be 0
 pSubtractFP
  the value to be searched for
 cP
arguments
after calling this function, stackC::extractF( tinP ) can be used to remove the item that it references
assumes that the stack was loaded with values by "sinking" them, using sinkF, specifying the same pSubtractFP
 2 indicates that cP was found at the position just below the top of the stack
 1 indicates that cP was found at the top of the stack
evaluates to the slot id of the plate whose value equals cP
