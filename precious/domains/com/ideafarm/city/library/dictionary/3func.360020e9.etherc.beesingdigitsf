 a triple low tone ends the sequence
  it is used only to make it easier for a human to count the high tones correctly
  this pause has no meaning
 a pause occurs after each group of 4 high tones
 for each digit, 0 or more (up to 15) high tones occur
  left to right, in IFC digit ordering
 the digits are toned from least significant to most significant
 a single medium tone delimits each digit
 a double low tone begins the sequence
the code is simple
uses audible tones to communicate the value of cP
