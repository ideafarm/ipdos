 for tlsBlobC objects, multiple name spaces can be created by specifying a group name
  tlsBlobC objects can be used at any time, including at almost the very beginning and almost the very end of process execution
  unnamed objects are useful as a speedy alternative to obtaining an allocation from a poolC object
  unnamed objects cannot be used to share data across stack frames
 tlsBlobC objects can be unnamed
 the tlsBlobC objects cannot be seen by other threads
on a given thread, the behavior of tlsBlobC and static objects is similar but not the same
the tlsBlobC class provides a kind of storage class not supported in the C++ language
