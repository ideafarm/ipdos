 for example, i am used in the definition of BOOLcLASSESpTR
i exist for coding convenience and should not be used except where calling memcmpIF is inconvenient
with nonze cbP i duplicate the function of memcmpIF and am slightly less efficient
  else i perform a memory compare of exactly cbP bytes
  if 0 then i perform a (null terminated) string compare
  can be 0
