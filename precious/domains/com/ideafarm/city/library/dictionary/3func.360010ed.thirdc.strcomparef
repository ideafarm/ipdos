U::THE FILTER STUFF IS NOT CODED UP YET
   use bReverseP == 1 to compare, for example, 128-bit numeric values
   in this case, ccP must not be 0
  if 1 then compares from right to left, from high address to low address
  if 0 then compares from left to right, from low address to high address
 bReverseP
   else pcFilterP must point to ccFilterP countT objects
   if 0 then pcFilterP is assumed to be null terminated
  can be 0
 ccFilterP
   ignore all pairs at or above offset xx: 
   ignore the element pair at offset xx: pcFilterP[ xx ] = -1 ;
   normal comparison: pcFilterP = 0 ;
  how to
   pcFilterP[ xx ] is -2: all bits are ignored except the low bit (use for filtering on "odd" or "even")
   pcFilterP[ xx ] is  0: normal comparison of the element pair at offset xx
   pcFilterP[ xx ] is -1: the element pair at offset xx is not inspected
   pcFilterP       is  0: normal comparison of element pairs using all bits
  examples
    each element specifies the bits to be ignored (i.e. are wild) in the corresponding comparision of a pc1P pc2P element pair
   if not 0 then can point to a string of any length
   if 0 then all bits are used for each comparison
  can be 0
 pcFilterP
  if not 0 then only ccMaxP element pairs will be inspected
  can be 0
 ccMaxP
   if not 0 then pc1P and pc2P are assumed to each point to ccP countT objects
   if 0 then pc1P and pc2P are assumed to point to null terminated strings of countT objects
  can be 0
 ccP
  must not be 0
 pc2P
  must not be 0
 pc1P
arguments
 if one of the strings is exhausted without finding a difference, evaluates to the difference in length, in countT objects, of the two strings
 evaluates to the difference within the first pair of distinct countT objects
evaluates to a positive number iff pc1P is "greater than" pc2P
