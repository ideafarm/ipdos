so, until i replace Nero, i cannot take advantage of this to prevent the use of copies
Nero, an otherwise good product, modifies volser when adding files!
if the cd burner can add files without changing the volser, then the login validation code can use the volser that i store to verify that a copy is not being used
creates a physical key file that can be burned onto a cdrom that is currently in the cdrom drive and is already formatted
