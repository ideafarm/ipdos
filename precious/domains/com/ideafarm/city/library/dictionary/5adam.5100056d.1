this restriction can be worked around by defining an initF member function, and calling it in the constructor for envS
this technique can only be used for fields that need not be constructed
significant limitation: dataS cannot have a constructor
 the idea is to use a union
this code illustrates a technique for documenting and enforcing read only vs readwrite access to data members of cpp classes
