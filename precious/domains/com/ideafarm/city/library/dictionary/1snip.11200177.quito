#define QUITO(pcQuitP) const countT* _pcQuitSave = tinP.pcQuit ; tinP.pcQuit = (pcQuitP) ;

/**/
/*1*//*QUITO(pcQuitP)*//*1*/
*/
code that refers to me -must- use QUITR to undo my effects
 to cause quitting to be controled by some other countT value, specify QUITO( &someCount )
to suppress quitting, either specify QUITOZ or QUITO( )
for example, etherC::boxMenuF will return a useable but incomplete list if asynch impotence occurs while it is working
on each thread, tinP.pcQuit is initially set to &(const countT&)etPrime
some system functions inspect tinP.pcQuit and silently quit early (no impotence) if *tinP.pcQuit
use me to modify the default early quit behavior for system functions
