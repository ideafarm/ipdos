 the symbol ifcSTACKtYPE_ISpOINTER is provided to allow applications to test (by logical anding with stackC::flags) whether the type is a pointer type
 for stackC objects of a pointer type, attempts to push or sink a 0 value result in impotence
if bit 01 is set then each plate contains a pointer value, which is not allowed to be 0
