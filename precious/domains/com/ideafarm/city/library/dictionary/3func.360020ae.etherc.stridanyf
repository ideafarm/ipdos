arguments
 see doc for strIsInQuoteF for notes on how sttQuoteP is set at the beginning and at the end of a quote
 see doc for strIsInQuoteF for notes on which quote marks are recognized
 sttQuoteP is either 0 or contains the last quote mark encountered
initialize sttQuoteP to the quote state at idFirstP
skips over quoted strokes when searching for the first match
idFirstP will point to the stroke after the ones found
evaluates to the id in psttBigP of the first occurance of stroke sttSmall
