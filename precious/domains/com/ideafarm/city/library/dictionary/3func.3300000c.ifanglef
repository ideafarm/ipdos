 angles increasing from 0 sweep the circle counterclockwise from the rightmost point
 both bounds correspond to the rightmost point on a circle
the range of a foreign angle is [0,PI*2]
 angles increasing from 0 sweep the circle clockwise from the lowest point
 both bounds correspond to the base (lowest) point on a circle
the range of an ifc angle is [0,1]
i map foreign angle values to ifc angle values
