   |     they will be changed to b iff the process is in the foreground (e.g. the window is selected by the mouse)
   |    if another thread then calls me specifying NORMAL, all RUSH threads will be changed from 6 to either b or 9
   |    if another thread then calls me specifying IDLE, all RUSH threads will be changed from a1 to 6
   |    if another thread then calls me specifying RUDE, all RUSH threads will be changed from f to a1
   |    my thread will remain at f until another thread calls me
   |    this initially results in my thread being assigned priority f
   |   calling me specifying RUSH
   |  example
   |    after that happens, if i am called specifying IDLE, NORMAL, or RUSH, then all of the IDLE threads will drop back from 01 to 1
   |    but if another thread calls me specifying RUDE, all threads that i have assigned IDLE will be changed from 1 to 01
   |    my thread will remain at 1 even if another thread calls me specifying NORMAL or RUSH
   |    this initially results in my thread being assigned priority 1
   |   calling me specifying IDLE
   |  example
   |  the re'th column is copied from the windows programmers' reference information in the toolkit
   |  the oo'th column indicates the base priority number that windows assigns to the thread
   |  the leftmost column indicates the result of calling me
   |  windows assigns a "base priority" that is a number in [1-f1]
   | how to read this table:
   | 
   table: effective thread priority (excluding dynamic boosts) for windows
   i handle this by setting both the thread priority and the process priority
   a thread's priority is determined by both the thread priority setting and by the process priority in effect
   windows implements the concept of "process priority"
  on windows, will also affect the priority of other threads in the process
 on operating systems that use "process priority", i will also set the process priority
sets the priority of the current thread
