  this object will be passed as a reference to pFP
  if not 0 then must point to a countT object that will still exist at fire time
 pcArgP
  if not 0 then will be called when tmWatchF detects asynchronous impotence
 pFP
 tinP
arguments
 application code must ensure that this does not happen
 since i am not serialized, tinP.pAdamGlobal1->_etherC_.pCalledWhenFiredF might be called with an arg that is legal only for its predecessor
i can be called to reset pFP
