 if this is not done, leaks will be reported
 call DELzOMBIE for each element that does not have BM_HIGH set
the caller must DELzOMBIE each of these blobSP instances
on input, the BM_HIGH bit must be set in every element of pczNameP
i replace each recognized id value in pczNameP with a smart pointer, of class blobSP, to the value of that id in the dictionary
i am the inverse of dictionaryReplaceOsTextIF
