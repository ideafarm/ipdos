#define F(flagsP) ( (flagsP) & FL_maskFlags )

/*1*//*F*//*1*/
*/
  !( F(flNext) )                    this evaluates to 0 iff there are no flags set
   the reason is that the "!" will be applied to the flNext value, which, if legal, includes idGroup and idType bits
  !F(flNext)                        this always evaluates to 0 (code like this is probably a bug)
 examples
parentheses should be used whenever an operator is intended to be applied to the masked flags bits
  flFOO_SLOW & F(flagsFoo)          (the & operation is done at run time)
  F(flagsFoo) & flFOO_FAST          (the & operation is done at compile time)
 examples
for best speed, place logical operations to the right of me
the value is intentionally not enclosed in parentheses
