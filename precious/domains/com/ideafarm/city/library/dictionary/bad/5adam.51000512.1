  a "finite snippet" is a snippet that does not extend backward in time all the way to the beginning of the code stream
 the code for any finite snippet of the byteT stream is "lossy"; it does not contain all information needed to decode it 
 with the entire code stream, decoding is trivial
 it is impossible to decode a portion of the code stream using that information alone
 the codes for a current snip of the byteT stream refer back to prior codes in the byteT stream
the key concept is that of infinite referback
the stream of count01T codes has properties that are desirable for security
any arbitrary stream of byteT values can be converted into and then recovered from a stream of count01T values
