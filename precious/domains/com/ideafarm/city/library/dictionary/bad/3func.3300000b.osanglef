however, angle values are "always" stored using the ifc convention
so the trigonometric functions do not require mental translation
ifc and foreign conventions both treat the bottommost point as having cos = 0 and sin = - 1
 angles increasing from 0 sweep the circle counterclockwise from the rightmost point
 both bounds correspond to the rightmost point on a circle
the range of a foreign angle is [0,PI*2]
 angles increasing from 0 sweep the circle clockwise from the lowest point
 both bounds correspond to the base (lowest) point on a circle
the range of an ifc angle is [0,1]
i map ifc angle values to foreign angle values
