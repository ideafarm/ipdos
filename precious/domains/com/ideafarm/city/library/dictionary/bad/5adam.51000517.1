 for staticC objects, multiple name spaces can be created by specifying a group name
  staticC objects can be used at any time, including at almost the very beginning and almost the very end of process execution
  unnamed objects are useful as a speedy alternative to obtaining an allocation from a poolC object
  unnamed objects cannot be used to share data across stack frames
 staticC objects can be unnamed
 the staticC objects cannot be seen by other threads
on a given thread, the behavior of staticC and static objects is similar but not the same
the staticC class provides a kind of storage class not supported in the C++ language
