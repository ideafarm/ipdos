/**/
*/
  must point to 3 measureT values for the right vector operand
 pmBP
   col varies most rapidly
   row by row
  must point to ( rowsAP * 3 ) measureT values for the left matrix operand
 pmAP
   col varies most rapidly
   row by row
  on return, will contain cell value in rowwise order
  must point to enough measureT to hold all calculated inner products
 pmCP
arguments
 the right vector must have 3 elements
 the left matrix must have 3 cols
i do matrix multiplication quickly for vectors in 3 space
