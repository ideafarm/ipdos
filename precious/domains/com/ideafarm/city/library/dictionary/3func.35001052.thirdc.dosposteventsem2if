arguments
impotence has no effect on this function
  see, for example, a130104, which would otherwise hang forever when the busC server is down
 this ensures that kid threads waiting for a sign will not hang forever when impotence occurs
the sign is always given, even if this etherC object is impotent
unfinished: is this true for Windows?
this instruction has no effect if already set
 a thread that calls this can then end immediately
this function does not do -anything- after calling the os to post the semaphore
it is illegal to refer to this symbol in the definition of an adam
