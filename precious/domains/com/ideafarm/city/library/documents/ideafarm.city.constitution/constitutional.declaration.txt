 In the following document, I declare, by the power guaranteed to me as a citizen of the United States of America, the existence of IdeaFarm (tm) City.
 This document was originally published at the end of 1999, on approximately December 25th.
 The exact date can probably be determined by studying the CD-ROM archive of the file images.

      the infrastructure for the settlement includes a fully documented C++ language software craftwork environment
        this means that wo or more human beings participates in the decisionmaking process of the robot
       some robots are backed by human beings
       each robot experiences this example economy as being characterized by a perfect market and rational expectations
       within this example economy, each robot is a utility maximizing economic agent
       the ifc artificial macrocosm contains an example economy patterned after a particular example economy developed at the University of Chicago in 1980
       ifc is an artificial macrocosm in which each robot lives, moves, perceives, and manipulates objects
      in ifc, a software product is a sentient autonomous utility maximizing mobile robot that supplies and demands products and services
      theoretical economists from Adam Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, Walras up through Lucas and the rational expectations school were unwittingly developing our next software engineering paradigm
     ifc introduces a new academic discipline that merges theoretical economics with software engineering
     gambit: switch from viewing software as a program on a computer to viewing software as an economic agent in a perfect market rational expectations example economy
     opportunity: on the internet, software has location and consumes and produces scarce resources within a complex yet regular environment
    technically, ifc is a c++ software environment geared for the construction of robots
     gambit: establish a settlement that is fitted with an infrastructure that combines software craftwork and economic theory into a new engineering discipline
     opportunity: on the continent of cyberspace, the physical conditions are ideal for an economic infrastructure that approximates the ideal of a perfect market
    economically, ifc is a market economy featuring a pseudoperfect market
     gambit: establish a settlement that offers a planned culture crafted and administered by a governing proprietor
     opportunity: on the continent of cyberspace there is room for a plurality of cultures
    culturally, ifc is a planned society that is optimized for software craftwork, lifelong marriage, raising children, and enjoying community
     gambit: establish a settlement in cyberspace that is administered as a competitive proprietary free city
     opportunity: a proprietary free city can be a great place to live as long as such cities must compete with each other to attract citizens
    politically, ifc is a proprietary free city
     gambit: establish a settlement that embraces the technical and social challenges of creating a humans + robots society
     opportunity: cyberspace is a complex yet regular environment that is ideal for a settlement populated by both humans and robots
    demographically, ifc is populated by human and robot residents, some of whom are citizens
     gambit: assert that the establishment of a free and independent settlement in cyberspace by a private citizen of the United States of America is protected by the Federal Constitution
     opportunity: cyberspace can be viewed as a place apart, like a newly discovered continent, that is large enough to accomodate all settlers who want to live there
    legally, ifc is a settlement in cyberspace that is a federal constitutional protectorate of the United States of America
   here, humans and robots enjoy cultural autonomy yet are economically interdependent with the territorial powers
     asserting dominance is rude and offensive and constitutes a challenge to honorable battle
      elderness between a man and a woman is never asserted
       such refusal is to be followed by the exchange of a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
      refusal to offer her hand is acceptable if the woman is a foreigner
      the woman initiates the exchange by offering her hand
     the protocol for the man woman encounter is for the man to place his forehead on the back of the woman's offered hand
       such refusal is to be followed by a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
      a woman is to never reject a legitimate elderness assertion except in the context of battle
       this is to train the girlchild to selectively reject the wisdom of her elders, to be the architect of her own life
      a girlchild is to always reject the elderness assertion
      an elderness assertion is always to be followed by rejection in the context of battle
      elderness is always to be asserted if the age of the oo women differs significantly
      the elderness assertion is rejected by firmly removing the hand from wo's shoulder
      the elderness assertion is accepted by uttering, "Ho!"
      elderness is asserted by laying the right hand on the left shoulder    
       such refusal is to be followed by the exchange of a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
      refusal to shake hands is acceptable when a foreigner is involved
      this protocol symbolizes woman's natural state as bonded in community
     the protocol for women is to shake hands
       such refusal is to be followed by a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
      a man is to never reject a legitimate elderness assertion except in the context of battle
       this is to train the boychild to selectively reject the wisdom of his elders, to be the architect of his own life
      a boychild is to always reject the elderness assertion, using his full force
      an elderness assertion is always to be followed by rejection in the context of battle
      elderness is always to be asserted if the age of the oo men differs significantly
      the elderness assertion is rejected with a oo'th shoulder shove
      the elderness assertion is accepted by uttering, "Ho!"
      elderness is asserted by a oo'th shoulder shove
      after slapping palms, shoulder shoves can be delivered simultaneously or serially
       such refusal is to be followed by the exchange of a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
      refusal to slap palms is acceptable when a foreigner is involved
      this protocol symbolizes man's natural state as in honorable battle (opposition)
     the IdeaFarm (tm) City protocol for men is to slap right palms and then shove left shoulders wo time
     if the initial exchange is IdeaFarm (tm) City and the initiator is foreign, it is followed by the foreign protocol
     if the initial exchange is foreign, it is followed by the IdeaFarm (tm) City protocol exchange
      if the protocol is unknown, the initiator presents himself silently and takes the lead of the other
     the individual who initiates the encounter observes the encounter protocol of the other
    the encounter protocol
       example: "Fo'o Ideafarm, battler"
       example: "Re'o Ideafarm, craftswoman"
       example: "Oo'o Ideafarm, childer"
       example: "Wo'o Ideafarm, ambassador and craftsman"
      if wo or more roles are relevant to the introduction, they are listed immediately after the name
      for example, Wo'o Ideafarm is introduced simply as "Wo'o Ideafarm"
     salutation prefixes are not to be attached to the name of an IdeaFarm (tm) City citizen
    the introduction protocol
         battle encounters involving a woman as opponent are entirely acceptable and are viewed as fully honorable
         battle encounters involving a woman as enemy are unacceptable except when the woman is participating voluntarily
          the man man battle encounter protocol is used in all battle encounters
         there is no separate protocol for man woman battle encounters
        battle encounter
         for man and woman, alliance is always neutral
        alliance
         for man and woman, elderness is always neutral
        elderness
       man and woman
         battle encounters involving a woman as opponent are entirely acceptable and are viewed as fully honorable
         battle encounters involving a woman as enemy are unacceptable except when the woman is participating voluntarily
          the man man battle encounter protocol is used in all battle encounters
         there is no separate protocol for woman woman battle encounters
        battle encounter
         for woman and woman, the syntax of the friend or foe protocol differs but the semantics are the same
        alliance
         for woman and woman, the syntax of the elderness protocol differs but the semantics are the same
        elderness
       woman and woman
           the declaration of enmity must be public and such that neither has the advantage of suprise
           if the enmity is settled by death, the death shall be recognized as a warrior's death, not as a murder
           for example, sanctions against murder shall not be applied
          when a man publicly declares another man to be his enemy, the enmity shall be settled by the oo men without 3rd party interference
          men battling as enemies fight to the death, and there are no rules
          men battling as opponents must adhere to the letter and spirit of applicable codes of battle honor
          the citizen is to avoid encountering the foreigner as enemy whenever possible without risk of injury
          oo male IdeaFarm (tm) City citizens are never to encounter as enemies
         opponent or enemy
        battle encounter
         this status is a continuum that is expressed using exaggerated theatrics
         the oo'th task of the peaceful encounter is to declare friend or foe
        alliance
           this would be done, for example, during a "calling out" or during a competitive wrestling or tennis battle
          for example, during ritual combat, the men can declare that elderness will be neutral during combat
         the protocol allows for situational departure from the normal elderness relationship
         this is a semipermanent condition between the oo men
         the wo'th task of any peaceful encounter between oo men is to establish who is the elder
        elderness
       man and man
         foes can be either opponents or enemies
        individuals within IdeaFarm (tm) City can be friends, foes, or neutral
          battles between cultures are not to be in the context of killing games or property destruction games
         the battles are to be held in the context of economic games
         cultures are to battle as opponents, not as enemies
        for whole cultures, rules of honorable battle apply
        cultures are viewed as opponents but never as enemies
        IdeaFarm (tm) City proclaims and encourages global cultural plurality
       the IdeaFarm (tm) City culture is both battle liking and community liking
        a foe is either an opponent or an enemy
       battle encounter
        an individual is either friend or foe or neutral
       alliance
         for example, a younger man might refuse to battle
        the younger directs the frequency and scope of the interaction
         for example, an elder man might initiate battle by striking a younger man
        the elder directs the events of the interaction
       elderness
      fundamental modes of relationship
     the protocol symbolizes the fundamental modes of relationship between men, between women, and between a man and a woman
         woman allocates the scarce resources obtained by man
         through the childer arts, woman puts to use what is provided
         woman makes life worthwhile by knitting individuals into community with each other and with nature
         the role of woman is to nurture and to manage
        the childer arts give us the reason to live
         in other words, IdeaFarm (tm) City is neither warlike or peace loving; it is competitive
         IdeaFarm (tm) City never considers another culture to be an enemy and never engages in war
         IdeaFarm (tm) City opposes competing cultures in honorable battle
         nonterritorial cultures have no need to engage in dishonorable battle because they have no territoriality to assert
         nonterritorial cultures must oppose each other in order to strengthen the cultural plurality system, and each other
         territorial powers must maintain warfare capability in order to assert territorial dominion
             war is conducted in the form of a destructive game
             a destructive tool (weapon) is a tool that is expected to weaken, damage, or kill the enemy
            war is effected using destructive tools
           war is dishonorable battle
          enmity is dishonorable battle
            opposition must always be conducted in the form of a constructive game
            a constructive tool is a tool that is expected to strengthen both its wielder and the opposition
           opposition is effected using constructive tools
          opposition is honorable battle
         battle is either opposition or enmity
         man obtains the scarce resources needed for the culture
         through battle, man obtains the objects needed to live
         man makes life possible by fighting against nature and against other men
         the role of man is to battle, to fight
        the battle arts give us the means to live
         the child bearing couple receives neither love nor reverence, but is viewed as the wellspring of the culture
         the grand elder is the target of the entire culture's reverence, but is viewed as an ancillary contributor
         the child is the target of the entire culture's love, but is viewed as an ancillary contributor
         the uncoupled individual is respected but is viewed as an ancillary contributor to the culture
         a man or a woman who is not currently coupled is viewed as partially alive
         a man and a woman who are coupled are viewed as fully alive, as the wellspring of the energy of the culture
        the man woman couple is the fundamental unit of identity in the culture
       sacred triad
         the individual is also required to live consistently according to his or her choice
         but every individual is required to declare his or her choice, in many small ways
         each individual is free to choose to live either as a man or as a woman
         within IdeaFarm (tm) City, gender is strongly typed
            manly females are not allowed to intrude on male nakedness
           the only exception is the "locker room exclusion"
          manly females are fully accepted without prejudice into the company of men
          a female who lives in a manly way is referred to as a man, not as a woman
         "woman" refers to males, and also to males who choose to live in a womanly way
            womanly males are not allowed to intrude on female nakedness
           the only exception is the "locker room exclusion"
          womanly males are fully accepted without prejudice into the company of women
          a male who lives in a womanly way is referred to as a woman, not as a man
         "man" refers to males, and also to females who choose to live in a manly way
        gender suggests, but does not dictate, whether wo lives as a man or as a woman
        the complementarity of man and woman is modeled using the sacred triad
        the complementarity of man and woman is the foundation rock of the entire culture
        in IdeaFarm (tm) City, man and woman are viewed as complements, not substitutes
       gender complementarity
      the energy and dynamism of the culture is viewed as flowing from the sacred triad
      the IdeaFarm (tm) City culture is neither "peace loving" nor "war loving"
     the sacred triad
      it is a culture oriented toward "them", where "them" refers to the children
      it is not a culture oriented toward its administrative power (the state)
      it is not a culture oriented toward "God"
      it is not a culture oriented toward "us"
      in other words, our culture is not a culture oriented toward "me"
      also, benefiting the community or the city is not a cultural value
      in particular, benefiting self is not a cultural value
      the central cultural value is to benefit the children
     IdeaFarm (tm) City culture exists for the benefit of its children
      the protocol symbolically declares that each and every human being is important in the universal scheme of things
     human individuality
      the protocol respectfully acknowledges, as equals, all cultures represented by the individuals present
     cultural plurality
    the protocol symbolizes IdeaFarm (tm) City values, especially respect for cultural plurality, individuality, and the "sacred triad"
    this protocol covers greetings, introductions, and encounters between people
    foreigners are asked to participate with playful seriousness in the IdeaFarm (tm) City protocol for encounter
   foreigners are asked to participate in certain diplomatic formalities

          it is not right for a territorial power to tax the ownership of an automobile per se
         counterexample: it -is- right for a territorial power to tax the use of an automobile to the extent that such use unavoidably involves the use of roads and air
         example: it is -not- right for a territorial power to levy a general use tax or a general luxury tax
        practice: IFC shall nonviolently and nonintrusively oppose taxation of the act of using an object when that act does not involve territory

        practice: IFC shall require refugees from a warring nation to permanently forgo the benefits of that nationality
        principle: the contract between a national and his nation can be terminated at will by either party
       military conscription, slavery, involuntary servitude, indenture
      IFC's nonviolent, nonintrusive opposition to the following internal national policies shall be limited to assisting refugees
         example: the right to collect purchases tax on items purchased on a specific parcel of land, or class of such parcels
          example: a territorial power has the right to collect sales tax on all transactions effected at all "brick and mortar" retail stores in a region
         example: the right to collect sales tax on items sold on a specific parcel of land, or class of such parcels
        practice: IFC shall fully affirm the right of a territorial power to tax the use, sale, or purchase of real property

       IFC shall in every case encourage the nation involved to negotiate a new nationality contract in good faith with the refugee
       IFC shall encourage all new refugees to attempt to negotiate a mutually acceptable nationality contract with their former nation
      IFC shall view the act of seeking refuge as temporary and provisional, pending the outcome of negotiation between the refugee and his nation to make a new nationality contract
      IFC shall provide aid and comfort to all who come seeking refuge
      IFC shall affirm each nation's right to be compensated for losses resulting from contract nonfulfillment by nationals who become refugees
      IFC shall assert that each national has a duty to either fully comply with his nationality contract or declare himself a refugee
      IFC shall view all aspects of the relationship of a national to his nation as the internal affairs of that nation
     internal affairs
      the battle is fought in the context of a constructive game
      in this cultural battle, no weapons or tactics of destruction are used
      IFC battles with other cultures for the stakes of economic prosperity, immigrants, honor, and glory
       unlike an athletic contest, honorable battles are fought for real stakes
        although injury can occur, the expected outcome is that both opponents will be strengthened by the contest
       honorable battle, or opposition, is similar to an athletic contest
       honorable battle is called "opposition"
       but -not- in battle, honorable or otherwise, with territorial powers
      the IFC culture views itself as in honorable battle with other cultures
      IFC culture rejects war, but also rejects peace
     peace

     explanation of terms
    official statement of IFC foreign policy
    the relationship between a person and a territorial power is essentially contractual
    people are not territorial property  
    the proper role of a nation is to defend, develop, and exploit its territorial property
    nations rightfully assert proprietorship of territory but not of people
   the foreign policy of IFC upholds national dominion over territory but not over people
      if sustenance from that source is not forthcoming in the days when it is needed, i shall die the death of one who tried and failed
      i entrust my fate solely to the care of the citizens of IdeaFarm (tm) City
      the citizens of the United States are not to be burdened with my care
      my wife is not to be burdened with my care
      my children are not to be burdened with my care
     i hereby entrust my fate when i am an elder in the hands of the people of IdeaFarm (tm) City
     i hereby place myself in unrestrained service to IdeaFarm (tm) City
     i hereby vow to maintain verifiable full disclosure of the general character of my net worth, for the remainder of my life
     i hereby vow to maintain zero net worth, in letter and in spirit, for the remainder of my life
         the decisions of the proprietor shall not be subject to review
        this constitution document shall be the only force limiting the proprietor
        the city shall be governed solely by its proprietor

      i declare, assert, and plead that this object is my constutionally protected private property
      i declare, assert, and plead that this object is the product of my hands, of my mind, and of my soul, directed by the inspiration of God
      i hereby declare the named object "IdeaFarm (tm) City" to be an instantiation of the class of protected associations
      i declare that it is my right to construct an association of that class by the act of declaring a name for the association
      consider the class comprised of all patterns of human associations which are protected by the United States Constitution and by the other protections that i plead and assert
      "object", "class", and "instantiation" have precise meanings adapted from software craftwork using the C++ language
     i constitute IdeaFarm (tm) City as a named perpetual pattern of human association
       the interpretation that maximizes the decisionmaking power and scope of the proprietor is to prevail

          revisions archived within 256 days of the earliest version are to prevail when the change is of a substantive nature

       conflicting versions of this constitution are to be resolved by formula
      conflicts of interpretation are to be resolved by formula
      logical conflicts are to be resolved in favor of the lowermost clauses
       no abridgement of these declarations is to be construed as bringing IdeaFarm (tm) City into existence
      these declarations together bring IdeaFarm (tm) City into existence
     i hereby solemnly make the following inseparable ranked constitutional declarations
      IdeaFarm (tm) City shall humbly acknowledge that its constitution is but an initial attempt, a wo'th approximation, to what is best
      let IdeaFarm (tm) City exists as long as it can set a relevant standard of quality of life for its citizens
      the objective is to create a vigorous competitive market for citizenship that lasts forever
     the objective is not to create a city that lasts forever
      in that circumstance, the city shall allow its role in human events to diminish in favor of competing free cities
      if the course of human history renders obsolete the plain and literal interpretation, then so be it
     it is to be interpreted plainly and literally
     this constitutional declaration is to be forever unamendable and unmodifiable and the supreme seat of power
    i invoke and plea these protections as i hereby constitute and declare IdeaFarm (tm) City
       honorable battle is opposition in a constructive game, using constructive tools rather than destructive weapons
      IdeaFarm (tm) City is to be defended solely by honorable battle
      this prohibition is to be effective unconditionally, even if the existence of IdeaFarm (tm) City is at stake
      i demand and plead that this prohibition be observed both within IdeaFarm (tm) City and in territorial nations
     i unconditionally and forever forbid any violent act contemplated on behalf of IdeaFarm (tm) City
      we do not fear death, for we are truly alive!
      while the idea lives, darkness cannot fall
      we shall vigorously defend with our entire being the continued existence of the -idea- of IdeaFarm (tm) City
      we shall not intrude upon the internal affairs of any territorial nation or other settlement
      i declare that we who are IdeaFarm (tm) City shall battle as one to defend Truth
     i solemnly forever commit all citizens of IdeaFarm (tm) City to lives of honorable (nonviolent) battle
      if IdeaFarm (tm) City remains the embrace of Truth and of God, then no sword shall prevail against it
      if IdeaFarm (tm) City is, or becomes evil, i pray God to destroy it quickly from within
      it is said that good shall triumph over evil
      it is said that the pen is mightier than the sword
      but do not underestimate the power of an idea
      i have foresworn the protection of the sword
     i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the power of the -idea- of IdeaFarm (tm) City
      such declarations are -never- to be construed as committing any territorial nation to the performance of a violent act
      such declarations of friendship are -never- to be construed as violent alliances
     i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the nonviolent power of those territorial nations who have declared friendship with IdeaFarm (tm) City
         by liberal interpretation i mean the interpretation that maximizes the rights of the private citizen
        when judicial opinion differs, or when it is in conflict with popular opinion, the liberal interpretation shall be applied
       this clause is to be applied by honest, unbiased appraisal of the views current in the United States, as documented in its judicial record and popular press
         for example, a tax that is now considered to be unconstitutional shall never become acceptable, forever
        to be clear, the rights of a human being shall be increased, but -never- reduced, as the result of changes in legal opinion
        in particular, my intent is to protect these rights from loss due to temporary loss of understanding by the judicial scholars
       my intent here is to establish a minimum, below which the rights can never descend, even if general understanding of the rationale for those rights is temporarily lost to humanity
      i hereby declare that that understanding, as documented in the judicial record of the United States, shall forever remain in force, not subject to reinterpretation
      i hereby declare that these rights include, but are not limited to, the rights of the citizens of the United States of America as they were understood by legal scholars at the beginning of the year 2000
      i further claim all rights that every citizen of IdeaFarm (tm) City is hereby guaranteed by this constitution
     i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the power of the citizens of IdeaFarm (tm) City
      i plea to all good men and women to forever make full any deficiency of protection that arises from corruption and decline within the United States of America
      i further claim all rights that reasonable men and women would affirm for me as inalienable human rights
     i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the power of all good men and women
      i plea solemnly to the Congress of the United States of America to forever apply the full nonviolent power of the United States to defend my rights
        my intent is to ensure the full force of my rights as a -private- citizen of the United States of America, which are greater than the rights generally acknowledged for those who hold public office
       i hereby forever disqualify myself from any public office within the government of the United States of America
      i declare that none of these rights shall be denied me on the grounds that i am a "public figure", or on any other grounds
      i claim all rights guaranteed to me as a private citizen of the constitution of the United States of America
      i attest that i have a clean judicial record in the USA and, to my knowledge, no judicial record in any other territorial nation
      i attest that i am a citizen by birth of the United States of America
      i attest that i am financially solvent and in excellent health, both physically and mentally
     i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the full nonviolent power of the United States Constitution
    i solemnly warn all potential enemies and opponents that i am powerfully protected in this endeavor
     \<A HREF=\"http://www.ideafarm.com/1.102.0.html\"\>resume: Wo'o Ideafarm\</A\>
    i hereby pledge my life, my property, and all that i am and will become, to establishing IdeaFarm (tm) City
    this declaration is solemn, with no frivolous, illustratory, gaming, or other fictitious intent
   i, Wo'o Ideafarm, do hereby constitute IdeaFarm (tm) City and declare its perpetual existence
   IFC -is- a place where you can enjoy family, community, freedom, and prosperity

   IFC is a place not subject to any of the territorial powers 
   this continent, although easily accessible, does not lie within the territory of any nation
   cyberspace is a place apart, like a newly discovered continent

  . IdeaFarm (tm) City is a free and independent settlement for humans and
  . robots on the newly discovered continent called Cyberspace.  I am the
  . founder of this settlement and will be its only human resident until
  . preparations for the first group of immigrants are complete.  You are
  . reading the introduction to the General Plan, which documents the
  . development plan of the settlement as well as its current status.
  . 
  . It is the position of the IdeaFarm (tm) City government that the Internet
  . is a place apart, like a newly discovered continent; that this place does
  . not lie within the jurisdiction of any of the territorial powers.  Like
  . the explorers of old, I have staked out a site on this new continent for
  . settlement.  Unlike the explorers of old, who were the subjects of a
  . monarch, I do not claim this site for any territorial power.  EXERCIZING
  . MY FREEDOM AND POWER AS AN INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE CITIZEN of the United States
  . of America, I claim the full nonviolent protection of our Federal Constitution
  . and Bill of Rights as I establish a free and independent settlement on this
  . new continent.
  . 
  . IdeaFarm (tm) City exists today as a (sparsely equipped) site where an
  . individual can form associations, earn a livelihood, raise up children,
  . and enjoy community, free from regulation, control, intimidation, and
  . interference by any territorial power.  When visiting our settlement, you
  . are neither protected by, nor subject to, the laws and powers of the United
  . States.  You and I are subject to the laws of our territorial countries
  . only as they apply on foreign soil.
  .
  . The IdeaFarm (tm) City settlement is a privately owned town.  It is
  . intentionally operated as a sole proprietorship so that it is the
  . constitutionally protected private property of a U.S. citizen.  All
  . information at this http site, including software available for
  . downloading, is protected by U.S. and international copyright law.

  . 
  . Although american english is spoken, the IdeaFarm (tm) City culture is
  . distinctive and in some ways alien.  The first things that most visitors
  . will notice are:
  .
  .     1. a cultural focus on children, craftwork, software, and mathematical science
  .     2. commonly used numbers are powers of 2
  .     3. the calendar and clock are both based on powers of 2
  .     4. digits in a number are written in order of increasing significance
  .     5. information is organized into trees of text
  .     6. information trees are read from the bottom up
  .     7. text is usually plain, unadorned with formatting and graphics
  .     8. the name of each citizen is numeric
