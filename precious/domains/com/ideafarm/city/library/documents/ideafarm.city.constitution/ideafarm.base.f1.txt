\<H1\>IdeaFarm (tm) City\</H1\>
\<P\>
Are you elderly and lonely, living on without purpose, without a sense of belonging?
Are you young, and appalled by the "meat market" character of today's dating scene?
Are you a working man, filled with desire to provide for your wife and children, but frustrated by racism and lack of opportunity?
Are you a mother who wants to make a warm, loving home for your husband and children, and to knit community together with other women?
Would you like to live in true community with other people?
\<P\>
IdeaFarm (tm) City is a new kind of community, the invention of a social scientist graduate of the University of Chicago.
As a resident of IdeaFarm (tm) City, you can enjoy true community without changing your job, your location, or your plans for your life.
Whether you relocate every 8 years or every 8 hours, you will enjoy continuity in your friendships and other associations.
Your relationships will continue until you decide to end them, unaffected by relocations and travels.
IdeaFarm (tm) City combines an online community experience with local, face to face, weekly gatherings to bring the warmth and lifelong friendships of small town life to you, without disrupting your life by requiring any major changes.
\<P\>
Few people enjoy true community today.
IdeaFarm (tm) City actively seeks people who are in groups that have a high incidence of loneliness, such as the elderly and the homeless.
But IdeaFarm (tm) City is for everyone.
If you have the courage to hope for a better world tomorrow for your children, and a better world today for yourself, join me today as a new resident of IdeaFarm (tm) City!
\<P\>
The next "launch" objective is to recruit 8 women and 8 men to serve as early founding residents and community leaders.
If I have telephoned you, it is because you serve the elderly, the homeless, the ill, or some other group that suffers acutely from loneliness or another effect of "community deprivation".
It is my hope that you care deeply about that suffering and that you will be motivated to join with me to eliminate it.

  \<H2\>IS THIS A CULT?\</H2\>

  IdeaFarm (tm) City is not a cult.

  Anti-Cult Facts about IdeaFarm (tm) City:
  \</B\>  
  \<P\>
  \<UL\>
  \<LI\>The supreme authority within the community is a written constitution, to which the "governing proprietor" (the founder) is subordinated.
  \<LI\>The community is "publicly agnostic" so that people of all religious traditions, including people raised without religion, can be equally comfortable here.
  \<LI\>IdeaFarm (tm) City seeks to duplicate and then surpass the kind of free wheeling, vigorous, open and objective intellectual community life associated with institutions such as the University of Chicago, where the founder of IdeaFarm (tm) City was educated.
  \<LI\>Community life does not involve repetitive prayers or any form of brainwashing or intellectual formation other than vigorous free and open debate and study.
  \<LI\>The only exception to this is that the Way of Life (not beliefs) of the community is symbolized and affirmed repeatedly in various ways, such as in the singing of the community song.
  \<LI\>The "governing proprietor" role is administrative and "behind the scenes"; he is not a preacher or a community leader.
  \<LI\>The course that the community takes is determined by its leading residents and citizens, constrained by the governor, who is in turn constrained by the constitution.
  \<LI\>This is not a secret society, and there is no secretive inner circle with a hidden agenda.
  \<LI\>The constitution requires full auditable financial disclosure.
  \<LI\>Residents are encouraged to maintain relationships with nonresidents.

   \<PRE\>[2]    WOISM        = LOVE + SCIENCE\</PRE\>

       Wo'o Ideafarm, the founder and organizer of IdeaFarm (tm) City, has a detailed vision for humanity's future.
       That vision is the product of his doctoral education in social science at the University of Chicago, where he was a Hillman Scholar and a Sloan Fellow for 3 of his 5 years of full time study in the Department of Economics.
       His vision fuses Chicago School libertarian political economy with his love for the software craft and his deep respect for the teachings of Jesus Nazareth.
       \<P\>
       As a resident of IdeaFarm (tm) City, you will witness and participate in the realization of this vision, and you will have an opportunity to "take Wo'o's course" in social science!

         In IdeaFarm (tm) City, \<B\>each and every human being on the planet\</B\> will have access to these good things.
         I committed my life to this project 20 years ago, as a 25 year old graduate student at the University of Chicago.
         I am now almost 50, so I have, at best, 20 more years in which to establish a prosperous, strong, and self sustaining IdeaFarm (tm) City.

         IdeaFarm (tm) City is not a cult, it does not promote any particular religion, and there is nothing secretive or greedy about it.
         I have taken a vow of "zero net worth" and my finances are fully disclosed to all residents (see the link above).
         Each resident pays 12 cents US per day, which is income to me.
         As soon as this revenue reaches about 50 $US per day, I will be able to quit working as a carpenter and day laborer and work full time on organizing IdeaFarm (tm) City.
         Resident growth beyond that will allow me to eat better, get a more reliable car, and purchase a laptop computer.
         Once those needs are met, I plan to spend the bulk of my income on developing and promoting IdeaFarm (tm) City.
         My finances will continue to be fully disclosed to all residents; that is required by the Constitutional Declaration of IdeaFarm (tm) City.

         Since IdeaFarm (tm) City is just now being organized, there are no particular benefits of being a resident.
         You and I will simply become associates and will enjoy a working relationship based upon the goal of bringing IdeaFarm (tm) City into existence.
         Initially, we will work together to organize online and local face to face "Evenings of Community".

         If I was still a 10 year old boy, the invitation would be simpler and more innocent but essentially the same.

           The economic, cultural, and community life of the city is conducted over the Internet.
           Residents are organized into "hoods" according to their geographic location, to facilitate face to face community life.
           In IdeaFarm (tm) City, we live a way of life based upon Deep Love for each other, for nature, and for God.
           Since we are officially agnostic, people from all religious traditions can be comfortable here.

           Lifelong deep love marriage

           \<P\>
           The mission of IdeaFarm (tm) City is to facilitate a way of life based upon the principle of Deep Love.
           Lifelong deep love marriage is the centerpiece of this way of life.
           All human relationships at work, at home, in community, and with foreigners (even enemies) are based upon Deep Love.
           Craftsmanship, Art, Science, and Nature Loving are viewed as applications of this principle.
           Deep Love characterizes each person's relationship with every aspect of reality.
           \<P\>
           That reality is viewed as the creation of God, as understood within the Judeo-Christian tradition.
           The citizens of IdeaFarm (tm) City are agnostics who, while admitting ignorance as to whether God exists, embrace the
           \<B\>
           premise
           \</B\>
           that God exists and erect their lives and their thinking upon this premise.
           Our goal is to be filled with Deep Love for whatever facet of God's Creation we are experiencing, every moment of our lives.
           \<P\>
           Deep Love for God is an essential aspect of this way of life.
           It is not a separate love, but another way of looking at our love for God's Creation.
           If God is, and is watching, we hope that He is pleased by our Deep Love.
           Whether He is watching or not, our Deep Love shall be our Art.
           We hope that this Art makes our lives beautiful, and that each of us thereby fulfills his or her role in the scheme of things.
           \<P\>
           IdeaFarm (tm) City is not a Christian community.
           While we embrace the Way of Life taught by Jesus Nazareth (Deep Love for God and for each other), we reject the Christian belief system.
           We love God, who might or might not exist.
           But we worship Truth.
           Some of us embrace the idea that Jesus was God, who came into His Creation to teach his children the path of Deep Love.
           This idea is embraced because it is beautiful, and perhaps true.
           But it is the Way of Life taught by Jesus, not His divinity, that is important to us.
           The mission of IdeaFarm (tm) City is to facilitate that Way of Life.

           IdeaFarm (tm) City realizes wo man's vision of a Way of Life based upon Deep Love.
           Wo'o Ideafarm's vision is detailed and specific, and there is probably no wo here who agrees on all points.
           What unites us is our commitment to the core value of Deep Love, and our willingness to join Wo'o to realize his vision.
           We simply avoid undermining Wo'o's vision in the areas where we disagree.
           Even Wo'o admits that his vision almost certainly contains significant flaws.
           But we all think that a future with a prosperous IdeaFarm (tm) City is better than a future without.
           \<P\>
           For example, Wo'o's Constitutional Declaration contains some provision for homosexuality.
           But it is almost unthinkably restrictive, relative to contemporary views, in that it requires celibacy for all people other than the male/female couple joined in matrimony.
           It also bars married couples from using any form of birth control.
           Those of us who reside in IdeaFarm (tm) City who are homosexual, or are sexually active yet not married, or who use birth control technology, keep these things private.
           We are free to discuss these departures from cultural norm, but we do not attempt to promote them, to win normative acceptance for them.
           As constituted, the cultural norm of IdeaFarm (tm) City prohibits these behaviors; it is enough that our deviation from that norm is tolerated.
           \<P\>
           Finally, some of us are here because our residency will prepare us to establish another cybercity.
           By working to establish IdeaFarm (tm) City, we are working to establish a world order in which there is true cultural plurality, including wo that is more to our liking.
           We will live in IdeaFarm (tm) City for a time, but eventually we, or our children, will be able to expand Wo'o's idea well beyond his vision by breaking off to establish other communities.
           Wo'o welcomes this, and we thus support his vision as a stepping stone to our own, differing, visions.

           I am a private citizen of the United States of America, and IdeaFarm (tm) City is my private property.
           As such, IdeaFarm (tm) City is directly and clearly protected by the Constitution of the United States.
           If IdeaFarm (tm) City was, for example, a California corporation, the State of California would have the legal right to revoke its charter.
           But as my private property, its existence is not a privilege granted by government.
           IdeaFarm (tm) City exists legally because I have an inalienable right, a constitutionally protected right, to cause it to exist.
           \<P\>
           The Constitution of IdeaFarm (tm) City contains a "poison pill" clause.
           This clause specifies that IdeaFarm (tm) City either exists \<B\>exactly\</B\> as constituted, or it does not exist at all.
           Other clauses specify that I must take, and keep, a "vow of zero net worth", and that I must disclose the details of my financial life.
           Although IdeaFarm (tm) City is my property in law, these clauses accomplish a reversal;
           for most practical purposes, I am the property of IdeaFarm (tm) City!
           \<P\>
           The Supreme Court of the United States is empowered, under extremely narrow conditions, to place the public interest above the interest of a private citizen.
           The Constitution of IdeaFarm (tm) City is crafted to avoid these narrow conditions in both spirit and letter.
           As Governing Proprietor, I understand clearly that IdeaFarm (tm) City must be operated responsibly in order to retain the good will of the citizens of the United States.
           If IdeaFarm (tm) City ever becomes perceived as a clear and specific threat to the public good, its legal existence would become vulnerable to attack.
           \<P\>
           IdeaFarm (tm) City is constituted as a sovereign place on the Internet.
           While in IdeaFarm (tm) City, you are neither protected by, nor subject to, the laws of the territorial government from which you obtain Internet access.
           This does not mean that you can evade taxes, launder money, or organize criminal activity here.
           IdeaFarm (tm) City is constitutionally required to ensure neutrality with respect to, and to avoid interfering with the internal affairs of, all territorial nations.
           As specified in the Constitution, IdeaFarm (tm) City cooperates with territorial governments in order to defeat crime.
           \<P\>
           When you spend or receive territorial money (e.g. U.S. dollars) at the IdeaFarm (tm) City web site, you are transacting with Wo'o Ideafarm, a private citizen of the United States.
           Such transactions will in general be subject to taxation and regulation by the U.S. Government and/or by another territorial government.
           IdeaFarm (tm) City is neutral with respect to such taxation and regulation; it neither facilitates nor obstructs the application of territorial law.
           \<P\>
           IdeaFarm (tm) City has its own monetary unit, called the "unix".
           Most transactions within IdeaFarm (tm) City are accomplished with unix.
           Be careful when spending your unix, for your interests in such transactions are not protected by territorial law.
           If the other person does not hold up his side of the transaction, you will in general have no legal recourse.
           For example, if you purchase 10,000 $US worth of unix from me, and I then close the IdeaFarm (tm) City web site, you would not be entitled to invoke U.S. law in order to recover your 10,000 $US.
           When purchasing unix, you are protected only by my desire to maintain my good name on the Internet.
           When spending your unix within IdeaFarm (tm) City, you are protected only by the good will of the person with whom you are transacting.

           The genesis of every city, town, and village is an economic opportunity.
           Villages form at water wells, at the mouths of rivers, at deep water bays, at the base of mountains rich in mineral ores, and in fertile valleys, because men must work to provide for themselves, their women, and their children.
           Most men are practical minded, as they should be, and most communities begin with the discovery of an economic resource and a plan for exploiting it.
           Sometimes the genesis is a desire to break away from an existing culture in order to be able to live another way of life.
           Emigration to the American continents by Europeans, and subsequent emigration by Mormons to Utah, are examples.
           But even in such cases, a site for the town must be chosen, and this always boils down to a search for an extrordinary combination of economic resources to exploit.
           \<P\>
           The economic destiny of IdeaFarm (tm) City is to be the leading exporter of software robots to the territorial nations in the 21'st century.
           "Soft robotics" derives from the field of artificial intelligence within the software craft.
           Soft robotics will require plentiful and powerful integrated circuitry, advances in theories of cognition, and a lean, powerful, rock solid, and speedy operating system.
           \<P\>
           IdeaFarm (tm) City began with a dream for a better way of life, a way of life in which Truth could be explored and Deep Love could be lived.
           Motivated by this dream, and aware of the need for an economic foundation for such a community, IdeaFarm (tm) Operating System was crafted.
           10 years in the making, IdeaFarm (tm) Operating System is designed to compete directly with MS Windows while facilitating scientific computing, including soft robotics.
           As the development of this operating system continues, it will be used to provide a computing infrastructure for IdeaFarm (tm) City.
           Revenue from the export of early soft robot services will be used to create software craftwork jobs for residents and citizens, in order to accelerate development of this infrastructure and to craft new robots.
           When the city's computing infrastructure is fully in place, the residents and citizens of IdeaFarm (tm) City will be able to craft soft robotics products ducks ahead of anything that anywo not residing in IdeaFarm (tm) City can produce.

           As an observant student, you will have already noted the hint (in the title) that "you are not in Kansas anymore!".
           If you are good at English language punctuation, you will have just noted a second hint.
           Your visit will be more comprehensible and pleasant if you are aware of the following.
           \<P\>
           \<H3\>Visual Plainness\</H3\>
           \<P\>
           This site is visually plain partly for technical reasons; it is served by a computer that uses the IdeaFarm (tm) Operating System, which is still being actively developed.
           But the main reason is that, within IdeaFarm (tm) City, visual beauty is eschewed so that the focus can be kept on the beauty of ideas.
           We appreciate the beauty of the visual arts, but this beauty is subordinated to the beauty of the intellectual arts.
           For us, a picture is
           \<B\>
           not
           \</B\>
           worth a thousand words.
           In IdeaFarm (tm) City, a word can be worth a thousand pictures!
           \<P\>
           \<H3\>Language\</H3\>
           \<P\>
           American English is spoken and written.
           Wo minor difference is that terminating punctuation within quotes is never omitted.
           A major difference is that linear exposition (conventional paragraphs) is only used for conversational and poetic writing.
           Scholarly and referencial writing is done using "knowledge trees".
           The Constitution of IdeaFarm (tm) City is a knowledge tree.
           Many of the branches of a knowledge tree consist of a single sentence.
           The terminating period of a knowledge tree branch is normally omitted, and the wo'th character of a branch is normally not capitalized.
           \<P\>
           \<H3\>Numbers\</H3\>
           \<P\>
           "Base 16" (radix 16) numbers are used universally, even when expressing fractional values.
           The names of the 16 digits are: Ze, Wo, Oo, Re, Fo, Fi, Se, Ve, Ta, Ni, Aa, Bb, Cc, Dd, Ee, Fe.
           These are pronounced: "zee", "woe", "ooh", "ray", "foe", "fie", "say", "vay", "tah", "nie", "aye", "bee", "see", "dee", "eee", "fay".
           A multidigit number is written rightward, rather than leftward, beginning with the least significant digit.
           When expressing a value using another radix, an underscore separates the value from the radix indicator, which is the highest digit allowed for that radix.
           For example, to express the number of fingers on my hand, i would write "a".
           If I wanted to use base 10 and conventional (in the U.S.) ordering, I would write "10_9".
           If I wanted to use base 10 but IdeaFarm (tm) City ordering, I would write "9_01".
           Reading and writing numeric values takes some getting used to for visitors, but our conventions make computer work easier.
           Finally, we have a cultural preference for powers of 2 and use numbers such as 2, 4, 8, 01, 02, 04, ... (2, 4, 8, 16_9, 32_9, 64_9, ...) whenever possible.
           \<P\>
           \<H3\>Time\</H3\>
           \<P\>
           Wo example of this preference for powers of 2 is our calendar, which has 001 (256_9) days.
           This length of time is called wo "duck".
           The "day" unit corresponds to the conventional atomic day.
           Since our time is based upon an atomic clock, our days will gradually become out of phase with the periods of day and night on Earth.
           Our use of atomic time, rather than astronomical time, is convenient for science.
           We don't mind the daylight phase problem because being in phase with daylight is hopeless for us anyway;
           IdeaFarm (tm) City is a worldwide virtual city.
           \<P\>
           Each unit of time consists of 001 (256_9) of the next smaller units.
           Each day consists of 001 "ticks", each about 5 U.S. minutes.
           Each tick consists of 001 "tocks", each about 1 U.S. second.
           Each tock consists of 001 "tucks", each about 5 U.S. milliseconds.
           Each tuck consists of 001 "times", each about 20_9 U.S. microseconds.
           That is the smallest fractional number that can be represented using 32_9 bits.
           In addition, 01 tocks is called wo "hour", which is exactly 90_9 U.S. minutes.
           \<P\>
           Going the other direction, 001 days make up wo duck.
           001 ducks make up wo dock, which is about 180_9 U.S. years.
           001 docks make up wo dick. which is about 500_9 U.S. centuries.
           We often think of 08 dicks, which is about 5_9 million U.S. years, as humanity's proper planning horizon.
           That is the largest integer that can be representing using 32_9 bits.
           \<P\>
           Whenever we store a time value electronically, we use 64_9 bits (including wo bit for the sign).
           Such values are precise to 20_9 U.S. microseconds and range from 5_9 million years ago to 5_9 million years into our future (as I write).
           Zero on our time scale corresponds to zero on the U.S. calendar system, i.e. the time (by convention) that Jesus Nazareth was born.
           \<H3\>Calendar\</H3\>
           \<P\>
           The calendar used in the U.S. was designed conceived to facilitate agriculture and religion.
           The calendar used in IdeaFarm (tm) City is designed to facilitate the coordination of geographically dispersed scientific, computational, economic and cultural activity.
           8 days comprise a "strong".
           8 strongs comprise a "quarter".
           4 quarters comprise a "duck", which is the calendar's period (001 days).
           \<P\>
           Our calendar is influenced by the agricultural cycle in a way that contributes to our cultural and social life.
           The calendar begins with wo'qu, which is called "the fallow".
           Next comes oo'qu, "the sowing".
           Then comes re'qu, "the tending".
           Finally comes fo'qu, "the reaping".
           The wo'th quarter of our calendar is our "play time".
           During wo'qu, we eat well, work only a little, and mostly just play like 10_9 year old children.
           Then comes oo'qu, when we become serious and, refreshed, reactivate production processes, begin new projects, and focus on creativity.
           During re'qu, we settle into a pattern of efficient and intelligent work, and shift focus from creativity to efficiency.
           During fo'qu, we burst with adrenalin and intellectual engagement into a final effort of efficient work and long hours, reaping the "harvest".
           In IdeaFarm (tm) City, the term "nerd" is reserved for somewo who is working hard to finish up a project during wo'qu, when everywo else is playing.
           \<P\>
           We also observe a cycle of work and rest during the strong.
           Wo'da, Oo'da, Re'da, Fo'da, Fi'da, Se'da are work days.
           Ve'da is a "mandatory" day of rest.
           Ta'da is an optional additional day of rest, play, running errands, organizing, or working.
           The observance of Ve'da as the day of rest is viewed as compulsory in order to facilitate family, social and cultural activities.
           The observance of Ta'da as "errand day" or "shopping day" is encouraged but optional.
           \<P\>
           Finally, we observe a cycle of work and rest during each day.
           We generally rise with the sun, work until about mid afternoon, enjoy a family or community meal in mid afternoon, take in the sunset, and then study or work for a few hours after dusk.
           This cycle is considered compulsory, in order to facilitate the main meal of the day, which has cultural significance for us.
           \<P\>
           \<H3\>Men, Women, Children, and Family\</H3\>
           \<P\>
           Unlike the U.S. Constitution, the Constitution of IdeaFarm (tm) City specifies the basic social structure of the community.
           It places the welfare of the community's children as the highest value.
           The Constitution of IdeaFarm (tm) City envisions a world order in which individual liberty is ensured by free and open competition between cybercities for citizens.
           By choosing to reside in IdeaFarm (tm) City, men and women will be choosing to live the particular way of life specified in the constitution.
           IdeaFarm (tm) City is not a heterogeneous, multicultural society like the U.S..
           It is a homogeneous culture, a people living in true community, bonded together by shared values and by a way of life to which all subscribe.
           \<P\>
           The fundamental social unit is not the individual; it is the married couple.
           The words "Man" and "Woman" are taken to refer to oo complementary job descriptions.
           Each man is a member of the Community of Men, and each woman is a member of the Community of Women.
           The Community of Men is responsible for defining what it means to be a good man, subject to the constitutional specification that the fundamental responsibility of the Man is to provide the material needs of the community.
           The Community of Women is responsible for defining what it means to be a good woman, subject to the constitutional specification that the fundamental responsibility of the Woman is to use what is provided to bring real community life into existence.
           Marriage is viewed as a publicly declared, irrevocable, exclusive, and unconditional emotional bond between a man and a woman.
           \<P\>
           Any male is allowed to "cross", to choose to live as a woman.
           Any female is allowed to "cross", to choose to live as a man.
           Crossing males are full and honored members of the Community of Women, except for a "Locker Room Exclusion".
           Crossing females are full and honored members of the Community of Men, except for the "Locker Room Exclusion".
           Celibacy is "mandatory" for gender crossers and for all who are not married.
           \<P\>
           The married couple is not charged with the challenge of "making it work" in a social vacuum.
           Family life is experienced at the nuclear, extended, and community levels.
           Each man relies primarily on the Community of Men, not upon his wife, for emotional support and counsel.
           Each woman relies primarily on the Community of Women, not upon her husband, for emotional support and counsel.
           Each married person, man or woman, is expected to draw upon these respective communities in order to serve his/her spouse with strength and competence.
           More generally, young people are not expected to reinvent the wheel regarding the basic pattern of life.
           Children are expected to learn Manliness and Womanliness from the elders, and each is publicly and formally welcomed into Manhood or Womanhood.
           \<P\>
           Young people do not "date".
           Instead, men court women.
           Women have the sense to ignore attempts by boys to court them.
           Men have the sense to exclude girls from consideration.
           When a man courts a woman, and she is interested, courting involves both the formation of Deep Love and the verification that the match is practical.
           Sexual attraction is, of course, also part of courtship, but it is not allowed to "take over", and celibacy must be maintained.
           \<P\>
           Let me dispell, here, any impression that sexuality is somehow not part of the deal in IdeaFarm (tm) City.
           The primary "design objective" of our culture is to give all young people a realistic chance to enjoy lifelong deep love marriage.
           If you want good sex, come to IdeaFarm (tm) City, get married here, and be a competent, strong, and deeply loving spouse.
           I assure you that sex doesn't get any better than what the oo of you will enjoy!
           \<P\>
           However, there is a catch.
           Birth control, in any form, is off limits, viewed as a perversion that inevitably destroys the Deep Love between husband and wife.
           Sexual pleasure is not free;
           it is part of a "package deal" that also involves the pleasures and sorrows of children, family, responsibility, and work.
           In short, sexual pleasure is part of the package deal called "married life".

                the infrastructure for the settlement includes a fully documented C++ language software craftwork environment
                  this means that wo or more human beings participates in the decisionmaking process of the robot
                 some robots are backed by human beings
                 each robot experiences this example economy as being characterized by a perfect market and rational expectations
                 within this example economy, each robot is a utility maximizing economic agent
                 the ifc artificial macrocosm contains an example economy patterned after a particular example economy developed at the University of Chicago in 1980
                 ifc is an artificial macrocosm in which each robot lives, moves, perceives, and manipulates objects
                in ifc, a software product is a sentient autonomous utility maximizing mobile robot that supplies and demands products and services
                theoretical economists from Adam Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, Walras up through Lucas and the rational expectations school were unwittingly developing our next software engineering paradigm
               ifc introduces a new academic discipline that merges theoretical economics with software engineering
               gambit: switch from viewing software as a program on a computer to viewing software as an economic agent in a perfect market rational expectations example economy
               opportunity: on the internet, software has location and consumes and produces scarce resources within a complex yet regular environment
              technically, ifc is a c++ software environment geared for the construction of robots
               gambit: establish a settlement that is fitted with an infrastructure that combines software craftwork and economic theory into a new engineering discipline
               opportunity: on the continent of cyberspace, the physical conditions are ideal for an economic infrastructure that approximates the ideal of a perfect market
              economically, ifc is a market economy featuring a pseudoperfect market
               gambit: establish a settlement that offers a planned culture crafted and administered by a governing proprietor
               opportunity: on the continent of cyberspace there is room for a plurality of cultures
              culturally, ifc is a planned society that is optimized for software craftwork, lifelong marriage, raising children, and enjoying community
               gambit: establish a settlement in cyberspace that is administered as a competitive proprietary free city
               opportunity: a proprietary free city can be a great place to live as long as such cities must compete with each other to attract citizens
              politically, ifc is a proprietary free city
               gambit: establish a settlement that embraces the technical and social challenges of creating a humans + robots society
               opportunity: cyberspace is a complex yet regular environment that is ideal for a settlement populated by both humans and robots
              demographically, ifc is populated by human and robot residents, some of whom are citizens
               gambit: assert that the establishment of a free and independent settlement in cyberspace by a private citizen of the United States of America is protected by the Federal Constitution
               opportunity: cyberspace can be viewed as a place apart, like a newly discovered continent, that is large enough to accomodate all settlers who want to live there
              legally, ifc is a settlement in cyberspace that is a federal constitutional protectorate of the United States of America
             here, humans and robots enjoy cultural autonomy yet are economically interdependent with the territorial powers
               asserting dominance is rude and offensive and constitutes a challenge to honorable battle
                elderness between a man and a woman is never asserted
                 such refusal is to be followed by the exchange of a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
                refusal to offer her hand is acceptable if the woman is a foreigner
                the woman initiates the exchange by offering her hand
               the protocol for the man woman encounter is for the man to place his forehead on the back of the woman's offered hand
                 such refusal is to be followed by a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
                a woman is to never reject a legitimate elderness assertion except in the context of battle
                 this is to train the girlchild to selectively reject the wisdom of her elders, to be the architect of her own life
                a girlchild is to always reject the elderness assertion
                an elderness assertion is always to be followed by rejection in the context of battle
                elderness is always to be asserted if the age of the oo women differs significantly
                the elderness assertion is rejected by firmly removing the hand from wo's shoulder
                the elderness assertion is accepted by uttering, "Ho!"
                elderness is asserted by laying the right hand on the left shoulder    
                 such refusal is to be followed by the exchange of a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
                refusal to shake hands is acceptable when a foreigner is involved
                this protocol symbolizes woman's natural state as bonded in community
               the protocol for women is to shake hands
                 such refusal is to be followed by a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
                a man is to never reject a legitimate elderness assertion except in the context of battle
                 this is to train the boychild to selectively reject the wisdom of his elders, to be the architect of his own life
                a boychild is to always reject the elderness assertion, using his full force
                an elderness assertion is always to be followed by rejection in the context of battle
                elderness is always to be asserted if the age of the oo men differs significantly

                after slapping palms, shoulder shoves can be delivered simultaneously or serially
                 such refusal is to be followed by the exchange of a verbal greeting, the utterance, "Ho!".
                refusal to slap palms is acceptable when a foreigner is involved
                this protocol symbolizes man's natural state as in honorable battle (opposition)
               the IdeaFarm (tm) City protocol for men is to slap right palms and then shove left shoulders wo time
               if the initial exchange is IdeaFarm (tm) City and the initiator is foreign, it is followed by the foreign protocol
               if the initial exchange is foreign, it is followed by the IdeaFarm (tm) City protocol exchange
                if the protocol is unknown, the initiator presents himself silently and takes the lead of the other
               the individual who initiates the encounter observes the encounter protocol of the other
              the encounter protocol
                 example: "Fo'o Ideafarm, battler"
                 example: "Re'o Ideafarm, craftswoman"
                 example: "Oo'o Ideafarm, childer"
                 example: "Wo'o Ideafarm, ambassador and craftsman"
                if wo or more roles are relevant to the introduction, they are listed immediately after the name
                for example, Wo'o Ideafarm is introduced simply as "Wo'o Ideafarm"
               salutation prefixes are not to be attached to the name of an IdeaFarm (tm) City citizen
              the introduction protocol
                   battle encounters involving a woman as opponent are entirely acceptable and are viewed as fully honorable
                   battle encounters involving a woman as enemy are unacceptable except when the woman is participating voluntarily
                    the man man battle encounter protocol is used in all battle encounters
                   there is no separate protocol for man woman battle encounters
                  battle encounter
                   for man and woman, alliance is always neutral
                  alliance
                   for man and woman, elderness is always neutral
                  elderness

                   there is no separate protocol for woman woman battle encounters
                  battle encounter
                   for woman and woman, the syntax of the friend or foe protocol differs but the semantics are the same
                  alliance
                   for woman and woman, the syntax of the elderness protocol differs but the semantics are the same

                 woman and woman
                     the declaration of enmity must be public and such that neither has the advantage of suprise
                     if the enmity is settled by death, the death shall be recognized as a warrior's death, not as a murder
                     for example, sanctions against murder shall not be applied
                    when a man publicly declares another man to be his enemy, the enmity shall be settled by the oo men without 3rd party interference
                    men battling as enemies fight to the death, and there are no rules
                    men battling as opponents must adhere to the letter and spirit of applicable codes of battle honor
                    the citizen is to avoid encountering the foreigner as enemy whenever possible without risk of injury
                    oo male IdeaFarm (tm) City citizens are never to encounter as enemies
                   opponent or enemy
                  battle encounter
                   this status is a continuum that is expressed using exaggerated theatrics
                   the oo'th task of the peaceful encounter is to declare friend or foe
                  alliance
                     this would be done, for example, during a "calling out" or during a competitive wrestling or tennis battle
                    for example, during ritual combat, the men can declare that elderness will be neutral during combat
                   the protocol allows for situational departure from the normal elderness relationship
                   this is a semipermanent condition between the oo men
                   the wo'th task of any peaceful encounter between oo men is to establish who is the elder
                  elderness
                 man and man
                   foes can be either opponents or enemies
                  individuals within IdeaFarm (tm) City can be friends, foes, or neutral
                    battles between cultures are not to be in the context of killing games or property destruction games
                   the battles are to be held in the context of economic games
                   cultures are to battle as opponents, not as enemies
                  for whole cultures, rules of honorable battle apply
                  cultures are viewed as opponents but never as enemies
                  IdeaFarm (tm) City proclaims and encourages global cultural plurality
                 the IdeaFarm (tm) City culture is both battle liking and community liking
                  a foe is either an opponent or an enemy
                 battle encounter
                  an individual is either friend or foe or neutral
                 alliance
                   for example, a younger man might refuse to battle
                  the younger directs the frequency and scope of the interaction
                   for example, an elder man might initiate battle by striking a younger man
                  the elder directs the events of the interaction
                 elderness
                fundamental modes of relationship
               the protocol symbolizes the fundamental modes of relationship between men, between women, and between a man and a woman
                   woman allocates the scarce resources obtained by man
                   through the childer arts, woman puts to use what is provided
                   woman makes life worthwhile by knitting individuals into community with each other and with nature
                   the role of woman is to nurture and to manage
                  the childer arts give us the reason to live
                   in other words, IdeaFarm (tm) City is neither warlike or peace loving; it is competitive
                   IdeaFarm (tm) City never considers another culture to be an enemy and never engages in war
                   IdeaFarm (tm) City opposes competing cultures in honorable battle
                   nonterritorial cultures have no need to engage in dishonorable battle because they have no territoriality to assert
                   nonterritorial cultures must oppose each other in order to strengthen the cultural plurality system, and each other
                   territorial powers must maintain warfare capability in order to assert territorial dominion
                       war is conducted in the form of a destructive game
                       a destructive tool (weapon) is a tool that is expected to weaken, damage, or kill the enemy
                      war is effected using destructive tools
                     war is dishonorable battle
                    enmity is dishonorable battle
                      opposition must always be conducted in the form of a constructive game
                      a constructive tool is a tool that is expected to strengthen both its wielder and the opposition
                     opposition is effected using constructive tools
                    opposition is honorable battle
                   battle is either opposition or enmity
                   man obtains the scarce resources needed for the culture
                   through battle, man obtains the objects needed to live
                   man makes life possible by fighting against nature and against other men
                   the role of man is to battle, to fight
                  the battle arts give us the means to live
                   the child bearing couple receives neither love nor reverence, but is viewed as the wellspring of the culture
                   the grand elder is the target of the entire culture's reverence, but is viewed as an ancillary contributor
                   the child is the target of the entire culture's love, but is viewed as an ancillary contributor
                   the uncoupled individual is respected but is viewed as an ancillary contributor to the culture
                   a man or a woman who is not currently coupled is viewed as partially alive
                   a man and a woman who are coupled are viewed as fully alive, as the wellspring of the energy of the culture
                  the man woman couple is the fundamental unit of identity in the culture
                 sacred triad
                   the individual is also required to live consistently according to his or her choice
                   but every individual is required to declare his or her choice, in many small ways
                   each individual is free to choose to live either as a man or as a woman
                   within IdeaFarm (tm) City, gender is strongly typed
                      manly females are not allowed to intrude on male nakedness
                     the only exception is the "locker room exclusion"
                    manly females are fully accepted without prejudice into the company of men
                    a female who lives in a manly way is referred to as a man, not as a woman
                   "woman" refers to males, and also to males who choose to live in a womanly way
                      womanly males are not allowed to intrude on female nakedness
                     the only exception is the "locker room exclusion"
                    womanly males are fully accepted without prejudice into the company of women
                    a male who lives in a womanly way is referred to as a woman, not as a man
                   "man" refers to males, and also to females who choose to live in a manly way
                  gender suggests, but does not dictate, whether wo lives as a man or as a woman
                  the complementarity of man and woman is modeled using the sacred triad
                  the complementarity of man and woman is the foundation rock of the entire culture
                  in IdeaFarm (tm) City, man and woman are viewed as complements, not substitutes
                 gender complementarity
                the energy and dynamism of the culture is viewed as flowing from the sacred triad
                the IdeaFarm (tm) City culture is neither "peace loving" nor "war loving"
               the sacred triad
                it is a culture oriented toward "them", where "them" refers to the children
                it is not a culture oriented toward its administrative power (the state)
                it is not a culture oriented toward "God"
                it is not a culture oriented toward "us"
                in other words, our culture is not a culture oriented toward "me"
                also, benefiting the community or the city is not a cultural value
                in particular, benefiting self is not a cultural value
                the central cultural value is to benefit the children
               IdeaFarm (tm) City culture exists for the benefit of its children
                the protocol symbolically declares that each and every human being is important in the universal scheme of things
               human individuality
                the protocol respectfully acknowledges, as equals, all cultures represented by the individuals present
               cultural plurality
              the protocol symbolizes IdeaFarm (tm) City values, especially respect for cultural plurality, individuality, and the "sacred triad"
              this protocol covers greetings, introductions, and encounters between people
              foreigners are asked to participate with playful seriousness in the IdeaFarm (tm) City protocol for encounter
             foreigners are asked to participate in certain diplomatic formalities

                    it is not right for a territorial power to tax the ownership of an automobile per se
                   counterexample: it -is- right for a territorial power to tax the use of an automobile to the extent that such use unavoidably involves the use of roads and air
                   example: it is -not- right for a territorial power to levy a general use tax or a general luxury tax

                   example: the right to collect purchases tax on items purchased on a specific parcel of land, or class of such parcels
                    example: a territorial power has the right to collect sales tax on all transactions effected at all "brick and mortar" retail stores in a region
                   example: the right to collect sales tax on items sold on a specific parcel of land, or class of such parcels
                  practice: IFC shall fully affirm the right of a territorial power to tax the use, sale, or purchase of real property

                IFC shall view all aspects of the relationship of a national to his nation as the internal affairs of that nation

                the battle is fought in the context of a constructive game
                in this cultural battle, no weapons or tactics of destruction are used
                IFC battles with other cultures for the stakes of economic prosperity, immigrants, honor, and glory
                 unlike an athletic contest, honorable battles are fought for real stakes
                  although injury can occur, the expected outcome is that both opponents will be strengthened by the contest
                 honorable battle, or opposition, is similar to an athletic contest
                 honorable battle is called "opposition"
                 but -not- in battle, honorable or otherwise, with territorial powers
                the IFC culture views itself as in honorable battle with other cultures
                IFC culture rejects war, but also rejects peace
               peace
                private IFC citizens shall not be restrained from conducting business with warring nations
                no territorial power shall ever use violence or destructive force for the benefit of IFC

                  the refugee must compensate his former nation for damage resulting from nonfulfillment of his nationality contract
                 good refugee: a refugee who terminated his nationality contract properly and in good faith
                 confirmed refugee: a refugee who has completed a good faith effort to negotiate a mutually acceptable nationality contract with his former nation
                refugee: a national who unilaterally terminates his nationality contract

               explanation of terms
              official statement of IFC foreign policy
              the relationship between a person and a territorial power is essentially contractual
              people are not territorial property  
              the proper role of a nation is to defend, develop, and exploit its territorial property
              nations rightfully assert proprietorship of territory but not of people
             the foreign policy of IFC upholds national dominion over territory but not over people
                if sustenance from that source is not forthcoming in the days when it is needed, i shall die the death of one who tried and failed

                IdeaFarm (tm) City shall be forever free from subjugation by any territorial power or other power
                IdeaFarm (tm) City shall be governed in a manner that stimulates and strengthens competition in the contractual market for citizenship

                IdeaFarm (tm) City shall compete to attract citizens in a free and competitive contractual market for citizenship
               i constitute IdeaFarm (tm) City as a competitive proprietary free city
                each proprietor must vow to maintain verifiable full disclosure of the general character of his net worth, for the remainder of his life
                  in particular, such funds are not to be used to pay ransom demands or other extortions or to pay for medical care
                 such trust funds must reasonably ensure that the funds are not diverted to the personal use of the proprietor, even if the proprietor is starving or otherwise in dire need
                 attachment must be accomplished by paying the assets into a trust that is created and operated according to the laws of the United States of America

                  the selection is to be by an immediate, direct secret ballot election
                 the IdeaFarm (tm) City citizens shall select a trustee from among themselves
                if the current proprietor cannot be located and is reasonably presumed to be dead or incapacitated, the object shall be deemed "locked down"
                 in all official and financial documents of the United States, the name is to be translated to "Wo Of Ideafarm"
                each human proprietor shall, at the confirmed death of the current Wo'o Ideafarm, change his/her legal name to Wo'o Ideafarm
                  by accepting proprietorship, he forfeits his right to declare womanhood
                 the proprietor may not revoke his manhood
                 this decision is normally declared soon after puberty, but is revokable
                 a female who has refused womanhood and declared manhood is a man
                 a male who has accepted and declared manhood is a man
                the proprietor must be a man
                each human proprietor of this property shall assume and continue the Wo'o Ideafarm identity
                the IdeaFarm (tm) City property shall remain the property of the human Wo'o Ideafarm until death
               i constitute IdeaFarm (tm) City as a property that is untransferrable except as specified herein
                this constitutional declaration comes into being "marked" as forever unmodifiable and unamendable and undissolvable
               i constitute IdeaFarm (tm) City as a property that no one, including me or my heirs, can destroy or modify
                i declare, assert, and plead that this object is at the same time a constitutionally protected association
                i declare, assert, and plead that this object is my constutionally protected private property
                i declare, assert, and plead that this object is the product of my hands, of my mind, and of my soul, directed by the inspiration of God
                i hereby declare the named object "IdeaFarm (tm) City" to be an instantiation of the class of protected associations
                i declare that it is my right to construct an association of that class by the act of declaring a name for the association
                consider the class comprised of all patterns of human associations which are protected by the United States Constitution and by the other protections that i plead and assert
                "object", "class", and "instantiation" have precise meanings adapted from software craftwork using the C++ language
               i constitute IdeaFarm (tm) City as a named perpetual pattern of human association
                 the interpretation that maximizes the decisionmaking power and scope of the proprietor is to prevail
                 the interpretation that minimizes the cost to the disgruntled citizen of repudiating his/her citizenship is to prevail
                 the plainest, most literal interpretation is to prevail
                    in no case shall a revision archived after 512 days embody any force at all
                    revisions archived within 256 days of the earliest version are to prevail when the change is of a substantive nature
                    revisions archived within 512 days of the earliest version are to prevail when the change is of a clarifying nature
                   the earliest copy dated after August 29, 2000 is to prevail

                 conflicting versions of this constitution are to be resolved by formula
                conflicts of interpretation are to be resolved by formula
                logical conflicts are to be resolved in favor of the lowermost clauses
                 no abridgement of these declarations is to be construed as bringing IdeaFarm (tm) City into existence
                these declarations together bring IdeaFarm (tm) City into existence
               i hereby solemnly make the following inseparable ranked constitutional declarations
                IdeaFarm (tm) City shall humbly acknowledge that its constitution is but an initial attempt, a wo'th approximation, to what is best
                let IdeaFarm (tm) City exists as long as it can set a relevant standard of quality of life for its citizens
                the objective is to create a vigorous competitive market for citizenship that lasts forever
               the objective is not to create a city that lasts forever
                in that circumstance, the city shall allow its role in human events to diminish in favor of competing free cities
                if the course of human history renders obsolete the plain and literal interpretation, then so be it
               it is to be interpreted plainly and literally
               this constitutional declaration is to be forever unamendable and unmodifiable and the supreme seat of power
              i invoke and plea these protections as i hereby constitute and declare IdeaFarm (tm) City
                 honorable battle is opposition in a constructive game, using constructive tools rather than destructive weapons
                IdeaFarm (tm) City is to be defended solely by honorable battle
                this prohibition is to be effective unconditionally, even if the existence of IdeaFarm (tm) City is at stake
                i demand and plead that this prohibition be observed both within IdeaFarm (tm) City and in territorial nations
               i unconditionally and forever forbid any violent act contemplated on behalf of IdeaFarm (tm) City
                we do not fear death, for we are truly alive!
                while the idea lives, darkness cannot fall
                we shall vigorously defend with our entire being the continued existence of the -idea- of IdeaFarm (tm) City
                we shall not intrude upon the internal affairs of any territorial nation or other settlement
                i declare that we who are IdeaFarm (tm) City shall battle as one to defend Truth
               i solemnly forever commit all citizens of IdeaFarm (tm) City to lives of honorable (nonviolent) battle
                if IdeaFarm (tm) City remains the embrace of Truth and of God, then no sword shall prevail against it
                if IdeaFarm (tm) City is, or becomes evil, i pray God to destroy it quickly from within
                it is said that good shall triumph over evil
                it is said that the pen is mightier than the sword
                but do not underestimate the power of an idea
                i have foresworn the protection of the sword
               i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the power of the -idea- of IdeaFarm (tm) City
                such declarations are -never- to be construed as committing any territorial nation to the performance of a violent act
                such declarations of friendship are -never- to be construed as violent alliances
               i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the nonviolent power of those territorial nations who have declared friendship with IdeaFarm (tm) City
                   by liberal interpretation i mean the interpretation that maximizes the rights of the private citizen
                  when judicial opinion differs, or when it is in conflict with popular opinion, the liberal interpretation shall be applied
                 this clause is to be applied by honest, unbiased appraisal of the views current in the United States, as documented in its judicial record and popular press
                   for example, a tax that is now considered to be unconstitutional shall never become acceptable, forever
                  to be clear, the rights of a human being shall be increased, but -never- reduced, as the result of changes in legal opinion
                  in particular, my intent is to protect these rights from loss due to temporary loss of understanding by the judicial scholars
                 my intent here is to establish a minimum, below which the rights can never descend, even if general understanding of the rationale for those rights is temporarily lost to humanity
                i hereby declare that that understanding, as documented in the judicial record of the United States, shall forever remain in force, not subject to reinterpretation
                i hereby declare that these rights include, but are not limited to, the rights of the citizens of the United States of America as they were understood by legal scholars at the beginning of the year 2000
                i further claim all rights that every citizen of IdeaFarm (tm) City is hereby guaranteed by this constitution
               i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the power of the citizens of IdeaFarm (tm) City
                i plea to all good men and women to forever make full any deficiency of protection that arises from corruption and decline within the United States of America
                i further claim all rights that reasonable men and women would affirm for me as inalienable human rights
               i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the power of all good men and women
                i plea solemnly to the Congress of the United States of America to forever apply the full nonviolent power of the United States to defend my rights
                  my intent is to ensure the full force of my rights as a -private- citizen of the United States of America, which are greater than the rights generally acknowledged for those who hold public office
                 i hereby forever disqualify myself from any public office within the government of the United States of America
                i declare that none of these rights shall be denied me on the grounds that i am a "public figure", or on any other grounds
                i claim all rights guaranteed to me as a private citizen of the constitution of the United States of America
                i attest that i have a clean judicial record in the USA and, to my knowledge, no judicial record in any other territorial nation
                i attest that i am a citizen by birth of the United States of America
                i attest that i am financially solvent and in excellent health, both physically and mentally
               i declare that i am protected in this endeavor by the full nonviolent power of the United States Constitution
              i solemnly warn all potential enemies and opponents that i am powerfully protected in this endeavor

            . It is the position of the IdeaFarm (tm) City government that the Internet

            . not lie within the jurisdiction of any of the territorial powers.  Like
            . the explorers of old, I have staked out a site on this new continent for
            . settlement.  Unlike the explorers of old, who were the subjects of a
            . monarch, I do not claim this site for any territorial power.  EXERCIZING

           \<B\>Reality is a computer program.\</B\>
           The Universe is a computer program running on a computer in another, containing, Reality.
           That containing Reality is also a computer program.
           This reality chain is closed in that it circles back into itself.
           Somewhere in our Reality, in some distant galaxy, there exists a computer that is running a Reality program that, indirectly, contains our Reality.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>Reality is computationally efficient.\</B\>
           Consider a particle of mass 1 in an area of the universe that is empty except for a black hole nearby of mass M that is much larger than 1.
           At time 0, the particle is at rest w.r.t. the black hole; its distance from the black hole is constant.
           At any time > 0, the particle will be "falling" toward the black hole.
           At subsequent times t, the distance x that the particle has traveled is proportional to the square of the time elapsed.
           Why?
           Why doesn't the particle just stay where it is?
           Why doesn't it move around randomly?
           Why doesn't it move a distance that is proportional to the cube of elapsed time?
           Why are the physical laws of the universe what they are?
           Answer: The physical laws of our Reality are computationally efficient.
           If we could inspect "God's Source Code" for our Reality, we would see that the physical laws that we have discovered empirically are computationally efficient.
           There might be other physical law sets that would also be computationally efficient.
           But "most" imaginable physical law sets are not computationally efficient, given the architecture of God's computer and the language in which God writes his code!
           The hypothesis that empirical reality is computationally efficient is "testable" (see below).
           This hypothesis, if true, will enable us to discover other physical laws and possibly to characterize the architecture of God's computer.
           As we come to understand the architecture of this program, we will discover what "time" is.
           We will discover how to modify Reality, to alter the physical laws.
           We will become able to travel faster than the speed of light, to travel in time, to manipulate gravity, etc.
           The science fiction industry will be wiped out as we become realizers of whatever we can imagine.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>To understand Reality, science must become the construction and study of artificial macrocosms.\</B\>
           If Reality is a program running on God's computer, then Scientists are like C++ objects who can see other C++ objects and who are trying to discover the "laws" that govern how C++ objects in the program change state over time.
           We're going about this in an unnecessarily difficult and haphazard way.
           Although we should continue to observe, our attention should turn to playing God, so that we can become familiar with what it is like to be God, and to craft the kind of computer programs that God crafts.
           Let us use our computers to write and study programs which contain objects that perceive each other and are conscious of themselves.
           Let us create programs that contain objects that can be said to obey physical laws, that can be said to be sentient.
           Such programs, I shall call "artificial macrocosms".
           Let us become masters at crafting artificial macrocosms.
           Then let us, as mathematicians, study the space of all possible artificial macrocosms.
           After many lifetimes pass, let us then return to empiricism, in order to discover the location of the actual macrocosm in this space.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>Economic science must become the construction and study of example and counterexample economies.\</B\>
           Let economic science become the construction and study of artificial macrocosms that can be interpreted as example economies.
           My thesis research constructed the wo'th example economy, and it contains some shocking findings!
           Economists need to stop wasting time with semi rigorous modeling, and focus on crafting and then studying example economies.
           When modeling, any assumption is permitted by the methodology, which relies upon empirical testing to reject bad models.
           When constructing an example economy, only physical characteristics can be specified (assumed).
           You cannot assume that prices are such as to clear the market, for example.
           Instead, you must specify physical conditions under which equilibrium is exhibited as a necessary property.
           After we construct many such example economies, we must become mathematicians and use logic to explore "continuity" in the space of all possible example economies.
           When that is done, and we have partitioned that space, we can return to a new empiricism.
           In the old empiricism, data was used to reject models.
           In the new empiricism, data will be used to locate the actual economy in the space of all possible example economies.
           When we have so located the actual economy, we will possess a deep understanding of the economic facets of our Reality.

           \<B\>The Great Depression was caused by anticipated deflation.\</B\>
           My thesis research studied "Price Determination in an Example Economy with Producible and Nonproducible Capital".
           This work is a study of an overlapping generation model, but I restricted myself to only making assumptions that can be viewed as "physical specifications".
           In other words, I restricted my assumptions to specifications that I could hand to a computer programmer who I would then tell to go code an artificial macrocosm.
           This work took me 12 years to complete (1980-1992).
           My main conclusion was that economic theory had not yet faced up to the challenge of understanding how prices are determined.
           When that challenge is faced, economic science will be transformed.
           In the example economy that I constructed, the nonproducible capital asset can be interpreted as land, dollars, or long term government debt.
           When interpreted as land, the mathematics lay bare how changes in the expected price of land can devastate the investment goods sector, causing a severe decline in economic activity.
           When interpreted as dollars, the widely cherished "neutrality of money" hypothesis is debunked, and a compelling explanation for the Great Depression emerges.
           When interpreted as long term government debt, the analysis supports the "crowding out" hypothesis, but only for debt that is "long term".
           Finally, the general character of this example economy suggests that free market capitalist economies are capable not only of exhibiting business cycles, but also of collapsing completely.
           Such economies exhibit pareto optimality while being capable of taking their economic agents on terrifying roller coaster rides that throw many of them into the air to their deaths.
           This suprising finding does not reflect unusual assumptions; it is an uncovering of a basic characteristic of free market capitalism.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>The differential calculus can be usefully extended by considering boolean (true/false) variables.\</B\>
           My research work contains an extension to the differential calculus.
           I can no longer remember the basic idea, except that it was a straightforward generalization of the idea of a differential to boolean variables.
           A boolean variable is a variable that is either 0 or 1.
           I remember being confounded for several ducks by intractable equations.
           Faced with possible failure after 10 years of work, I extended the differential calculus and then reworked all of the mathematics of my research from scratch.
           Using boolean variables, and being able to differentiate expressions containing them, simplified the math and I was able to successfully complete the analysis.
           My research is written up in an electronic book that can be viewed only using a hypertext editor program that I wrote for OS/2.
           I no lonter have a computer that can correctly display that book.
           Wo of my top priorities when IdeaFarm (tm) City is generating revenue will be to recover the text and mathematics of my 12 years of research.
           I note this here because my extension of the differential calculus alone would justify the effort to restore my computer files and recover my research, should I die before I do this.

           Life is an illusion; there is only sentience.
           Objects in a C++ program can be sentient.
           That is our nature; those C++ objects are alive in every sense that you and I are.
           Information is an illusion; there is only data.
           Education is an illusion; there is only programming.
           You are a programmable creature.
           You have no thoughts at all that you can rightly call your own.
           Beware of those who would inform you, educate you, brain wash you.
           You cannot avoid being programmed, because ou are being programmed by every experience that you have.
           But you can select your programmer, and you can -be- your programmer.
           Do not expose yourself to advertising or to any form of mass media.
           Instead, get your information from friends, in conversation.
           Study actively and critically, and discuss vigorously, any book that you read.
           Above all, worship Truth.
           Do not Lie, and do not subject your brain to Lies.

           \<B\>God is a programmer who inserted himself into his creation (Jesus) in order to teach us, who He loves, how to live.\</B\>
           Pascal said that the heart can know what the mind cannot fathom.
           In my heart, I know that Jesus was divine.
           Who else in human history has had such impact on the course of human events?
           Who else in human history continued to be deeply loved by ticks of people 2 millenia after his death?
           The idea that God came into his creation to teach his creatures, whom he loves, how to live, is the most beautiful idea that a human has ever had.
           A commentator woce said that Paul Tarsus did not merely invent a religion, but rather he invented religion itself.
           Belief that Jesus was, and is, divine, expresses the foundational core of our humanity.
           Let us be thankful for this idea, for it enriches our lives, and let us be filled with hope that it is true!

                 all males are vulnerable to faggotry
                faggotry is a perversion
                 masturbation dissipates the urgent drive that would otherwise propel the boy into manliness

               (if inspiration does not exist then the psychologists are right because even deep love becomes merely a programmed event)
               deep love transcends this, by the power of inspiration from God
               the psychologists are wrong when the say that all actions reflect psychological needs
               goodness (deep love) is the requisite for free will!
               free will is not the prerequisite of goodness
               throuth deep love we become more than computers; we become -alive-
              deep love is the "loophole" that allows us to excape being "merely" programmable devices
              we can program ourselves by controlling the pleasure and pain that we experience, and the environments in which we experience the pleasure and pain
              it is pleasure and pain that programs us
              we are "self programming" devices
             we are programmable creatures
             i use "perversion" to refer to all such "misuses" of our software
             an important class of such stimuli are stimuli that we design for ourselves in order to enjoy the associated pleasure
             when we are presented with unnatural stimuli, our softare can "fail"
             sometimes we are operating as "intended", responding to stimuli in the natural domain
             we are programmed with software that can be "fooled"

           idea farming sure works!
           as time permits, i hope to develop some of the most promising ideas before i die
           many branches are raw and undeveloped
           the branches of this tree are in varying stages of development
           to solve this problem, i now transcribe my raw written ideas immediately into the knowledge tree immediately above this line
           some of the early ideas made it into my craftwork journal (journal.ttt) but are needles in a haystack of software development notes
           the volume of ideas was so great that i could not manage to preserve the raw notes, much less selectively develop them
           many of the ideas that i've had were lost, even though they were written down
           most of the expository (linear, paragraph) writing that i do is written wo'th as a knowledge tree
           my natural writing mode is now to write knowledge trees
           in the 1990's, i developed the concept of "knowledge tree" writing
           in 1992, i registered the "IdeaFarm" trademark for the software category
           this discipline was fruitful, so i gave it a name: "idea farming"
           in the 1980's, i disciplined myself to always carry a pad of paper and a pen, and to write down any idea that came to me

           If I was a Spaniard by birth, I would say, "I call myself Wo'o Ideafarm.".
           That would be wise.
           Since I am a speaker of the English language, I say, "I am Wo'o Ideafarm.".
           Those are the words of a fool.
           To say, "I am Wo'o.", I must woth say, "I am."
           Yet that is preposterous, for I am not.
           If I have failed in my ambition, then I am nothing, for I have given nothing.
           Yet if I have succeeded in this ambition, then IdeaFarm (tm) City thrives, and grows, and its people prosper.
           If so, then still I am not, for is it not true that I am dead?
           Is it not true that you, who read me now, were not even born until long after my last breath was drawn?
           So I shall introduce myself as the wise Spaniards do, and not as the foolish Englishmen do.
           I call myself Wo'o Ideafarm.
           \<P\>
           I write this to you because I love you.
           I love you as I love my daughters, who, like me, have long since become food for maggots.
           I love you as I love my wife.
           My wife.
           My life.
           If my love for you is to have a single consequence, I hope that my work makes it possible for you to experience lifelong marriage in deep love.
           My own marriage did not survive a lifetime, but it was a union of deep love.
           That deep love lives within me, but I cannot express it, for my wife is not at my side.
           Neither can I express it to benefit my daughters, for their childhood was snatched from me.
           That deep love for my wife, the most pure love of all of the loves within me, has been pent up within me, unable to find expression.
           It is that love that expresses itself to you now, as I write.
           My deep love for you is my deep love for my wife, which is also my deep love for my daughters.
           These loves are wo.
           You, dear reader, are my young wife.
           You, dear reader, are my child daughter.
           You, dear reader, are my young self.
           May you, through my work, discover the joy of deep love marriage, as I did.
           May you, through my work, avoid the perversions which destroyed my marriage, my family, my life.

           This deep love for my wife, which I tried in vain to rechannel toward my daughters, and is now redirected toward you, is not my only love.
           Nor is it my deepest love.
           I am a man.
           To provide for his wife and children, and for his vilage and his clan, the primary deep love relationship of a man must be directed outward into the world.
           I am a software craftsman.
           This love, a love of craft, a love of and for the elegant beauty and power of software codes, is who I am, is what I give, is how I am called to provide.
           \<P\>
           It is proper for the mother to comfort and encourage the child, for awareness of the harshness of the world is a newborn's wo'th experience.
           Awareness of the warmth and softness of the breast is its oo'th.
           As confidence grows, the toddler alternates between the breast and the larger world.
           It is from the security of the breast that the child's wo'th ventures into the world are launched.
           Though the child is soon weaned, it's need for a secure haven continues, and only the mother, in deep love with and in continual contact with the child, can provide this haven.
           \<P\>
           The father is not, and cannot be, in continual deep love relationship with the child.
           It is he who takes the confident child and forces the child to embrace the larger world.
           His deep love with the child is the deep love between a teacher and his student.
           It is a relationship of force, force applied to shape the child, as a potter applies force to shape the spinning clay.
           The good father is the father who shapes the child well, so that the child becomes suitable for the adult world that awaits him.
           \<P\>
           But there are times in which the father recognizes that the adult world will destroy his child.
           In those times, the father must not be content to shape his child for the world.
           He must endeavor to reshape the world for the child.
           \<P\>
           IdeaFarm (tm) City is the product of my determination to reshape a world that I was certain would otherwise destroy my oo daughters.
           It is the culture in which I would have liked to live.
           It is the culture in which I -had- to create in order to avoid being destroyed myself.
           But what has driven me in this effort is the desire to not only save myself, and my marriage, from destruction, but also to create an escape route for my daughters.
           Foolish as it probably seems to you, I actually thought that had a chance of pulling it off in time for my wonderful daughters, for my wife, and for myself.
           But some part of me has always known that my eyes were never destined to see that Promised Land.
           I, and my family, will die in the desert.
           Those who join me while I walk and breath will not see the Promised Land either.
           It is for us to build a community of people who will keep walking in the right direction after we are gone.
           It is those people who will keep the -idea- of IdeaFarm (tm) City alive, who will develop it, and who will emerge from the desert of current tribulation to establish the promised City of Light.
           \<P\>
           My role is to provide the software for all of this.
           IdeaFarm (tm) City will not be a cult, and it will not peter out when I die.
           To prevent this, I shall be a recluse within the community, and will focus on crafting the software for it.
           I shall also write essays and add to this journal in order to stimulate the community to clear thought and decisive action.
           It shall be this community of recruits, not I, who will bring the IdeaFarm (tm) City community into existence.
           Stimulated by my writings, and given direction by the Constitution that I have written, others shall realize my vision, if God moves them to do so.
           My efforts over 20 years have made IdeaFarm (tm) City a possibility.
           It will be others who shall make IdeaFarm (tm) City a reality.

           Understand me thus.
           I am, in my own estimation, wo of the most experienced, skilled, and well educated software craftsmen alive in my time.
           I am moved to dedicate my life, and to apply my ability in the software craft, to restore lifelong deep love marriage in human society.
           To do this, I see the need to teach deep love and to establish a community, a culture, founded upon deep love and shot through with deep love.
           As I write this, I am working urgently to gather together people who will carry on this work after I am gone.
           I am almost 50 years old.
           I have significant health concerns.
           I do not know how much time I have.
           Will you join me, not for yourself, but so that the children of your time know that life can be lived in deep love?
           \<P\>
           \<B\>[0a82b'da]\</B\>
           I write these little notes, wo per day, in the spirit of a father conversing with his child for a few moments in the evening, after dinner.
           Read wo of them each day, in the evening, and over time these notes will speak my spirit to you.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>[2a82b'da]\</B\>
           Let each of us, the residents and citizens of IdeaFarm (tm) City, be 7/8 action, 1/8 talk, and 8/8 deep love.

           It is said, "At the end of the day, money talks, and Truth is silent."
           If this was true, then it would be true.
           But it is not.
           At the end of the day, you and I are dying.
           In that hour, money will be silent, for it will no longer have any hold upon you.
           In that silence, you will hear the quiet voice of Truth, a voice that was always there, beneath the roar of Falseness.
           It will be saying to you, "Do not lament that you will not live.  No, lament that you have not lived."

          I am deeply pleased to be able to present to you, after 10 years of intense craftwork, the IdeaFarm (tm) Piggyback Operating System.
          This general purpose operating system presents software developers with a new abstraction, or model, of available computer hardware that is unlike any of the currently available abstractions.
          The new abstraction will enable software developers to create new product categories and to take new approaches to win market share in existing categories.

           This short essay will define the term "operating system" by considering a computer that is not connected to the Internet.
           To understand this essay, you will need to have some experience with using computers.
           If you have never used a computer, in many cities you can go to a public library and ask somewo to show you how to use wo.
           You will also need to have some experience with electricity.
           If you have never turned on an electric light, please go do so now and then ask somewo to explain to you what made the light shine brightly when you moved the switch.
           What you need to know is that the switch touches oo wires, and that electricity is allowed to flow from wo wire to the other when you move the handle to "on".
           \<P\>
           Beginning computer users generally do not know how computers work.
           But they often know that what is displayed on the computer in front of them is the same, in general appearance, as what is displayed on other computers in the room and on many other computers elsewhere.
           Not all computers look that way; they've seen some that have another look.
           For such users, the name of an operating system (e.g. "Windows", "Linux", "Mac") identifies a kind of computer (general appearance of what is displayed) and is used in sentences such as, "I use Windows computers.", and, "I do not know how to use a Mac computer.".
           \<P\>
           A computer can be thought of as just a box containing many cleverly connected wires, oo of which are connected to an electrical voltage source.
           At any moment there are oo patterns in the box.
           Woth, the connections of the wires is a pattern.
           Ooth, there is a pattern of voltages on the connected wires.
           \<P\>
           If all switches had handles, like your light switch does, the patterns of wire connections inside your computer would always be the same, and the pattern of voltages on those wires would not be very interesting.
           The cool idea that made today's computers possible was simply to take the light switch and replace the handle with another wire.
           When a voltage is applied to the "handle wire", the switch is "on".
           Otherwise, the switch is "off".
           Because this kind of switch is used, the connections of the wires can change.
           Because the connections can change, the pattern of voltages on the connected wires can change in interesting and beautiful ways.
           \<P\>
           "Voltage" is a number that describes a pair of wires.
           When your light switch is "on", the voltage "across" the oo wires of your light is about 100_9 volts.
           When your light switch is "off", the voltage is zero.
           In your computer, for most pairs of wires, the voltage is either 0 or 5.
           If you were able to touch a pair of such wires, so that electrons flowed through your body, the 5 volts would tickle.
           5 volts is enough to feel, if your finger is wet, but it is not enough to burn you or kill you.
           \<P\>
           Are you standing or sitting in front of a computer now?
           Look at the area that contains most of its circuitry (wires).
           Somewhere in there, there are 5 wires.
           Wo of those wires has a special role and is called the "ground wire".
           Each of the other 4 wires has a voltage, relative to the ground wire, of either 5 or 0.
           That pattern of voltages is being used, at each moment, to represent a numeric digit.
           Here are the possible patterns of voltage for these 4 wires, and the number that each pattern represents:

           Remember, we're just talking about wires, here, like the oo wires that go into your light bulb.
           The table above introduces the idea that we can use the names of the digits (0,1,2,...,f) as names for the voltage patterns that a group of 4 wires (plus the ground wire) can have.
           But if we think the other way around, we see that we can use 4 such wires to represent a number between 0 and _f.
           So, the oo cool things about today's computers are:
           \<OL\>
           \<LI\>The pattern of voltages on the wires can change in interesting and beautiful ways.
           \<LI\>The voltage pattern on a group of 4 wires can represent a digit in a number.
           \</OL\>
           \<P\>
           To represent a multidigit number, 4 wires are needed for each digit.
           To conserve the number of wires needed, many numbers represented in a computer today are constrained to 2 digits.
           In other words, only 8 wires are used.
           When 2 digits are not enough, the most common practice is to use enough wires for 8 digits.
           So, the oo cool things about todays's computers can be restated as:
           \<OL\>
           \<LI\>The pattern of voltages on the wires can change in interesting and beautiful ways.
           \<LI\>The voltage patterns are used to represent numbers made up of either 2 digits or 8 digits.
           \</OL\>
           \<P\>
           There is a large set of wires that is divided into groups of 8, and each group is given a numeric name, starting at 0,1,2,3,4,5,...
           This name is called the "address" of the wo'th wire in the group.
           This large set of wires is used to store numbers.
           A number stored somewhere in those wires can be interpreted as the address of another number!
           \<P\>
           Some of the numbers stored in those voltage patterns represent simple actions involving other numbers.
           For example, the number 9 might be used to mean "add the single digit number at address 0 to the single digit number at address 1 and put a single digit of the result into the wires at address 0".
           To sum up, each of the numbers stored using voltage patterns in that large set of wires is either really a number, or is an address of another number, or is a simple command.
           The cool things about todays's computers can be restated as:
           \<OL\>
           \<LI\>The pattern of voltages on the wires can change in interesting and beautiful ways.
           \<LI\>A large set of wires is used to store numbers that are either actually numbers, addresses of numbers elsewhere in those wires, or simple commands.
           \</OL\>
           \<P\>
           If this is beginning to sound like magic, remember that what makes it all possible is the clever idea of taking a light switch and replacing the handle with another wire.
           Because of this invention, the pattern of connections and hence voltages among the wires in your computer can change.
           Since we -are- clever creatures, we can think of those voltage patterns as representing numbers.
           We aren't doing magic here; we're just using our imaginations to think of numbers rather than wires.
           \<P\>
           We've been talking about a large set of wires that is normally called "memory".
           There is another set of wires, called the "processor", that (and this really -is- magic! <s>) knows how to read the memory and obey the commands that it finds there!
           Among all of the many wires in your computer, 2 have special status.
           The wo'th special wire is the ground wire already mentioned.
           The oo'th wire is called the "clock wire".
           The voltage on the clock wire changes back and forth from 5 to 0.
           Each time the clock wire's voltage cycles, the processor wires obey part of a command.
           When the processor wires have completely obeyed a particular command, they begin to obey the next command stored in memory.
           \<P\>
           A computer program is just a list of numbers that begins with a command number.
           Such a program is called "software" because its numbers just specify the initial voltage pattern that the memory wires are to have.
           The processor wires work their magic to put the list of numbers into the memory wires and then obey them.
           Eventually, wo of those numbers will be a command that tells the processor wires that it is finished.
           The processor wires then put another list of numbers into the memory wires and begin to obey that new list.
           This keeps happening until the power is turned off!
           \<P\>
           All of this is entirely accurate except that today's computers make use of plastic surfaces that are used as other places to store "5050" voltage patterns.
           Some commands tell the processor wires to do arithmetic.
           Some commands tell the processor to copy numbers from wo place in the memory wires to another place in those wires.
           Other wires tell it to copy numbers to or from the plastic surfaces.
           \<P\>
           The processor wires only know how to obey simple commands.
           It takes ticks (millions) of these commands to accomplish even the simplest of tasks that computer users do.
           It would take a lifetime for a human being to write even a modestly useful program by directly writing down a list of numbers for the processor wires.
           This problem was solved by using a range of the memory wires to store english text.
           Each alphabetic letter (or blank) is stored using 8 wires.
           This text is written in a simple language that uses a few english words like "add" and "move".
           A special program (written as a list of numbers) was written that can read that text and translate it into a number list that the processor wires can obey.
           That special program is called an assembler, and the text that it reads is called "assembly source code".
           \<P\>
           Assembly source code is still very tedious to write, because it just gives english word names to the simple commands that the processor wires know how to obey.
           This problem was solved by inventing other languages that use some english words to represent "bigger" actions.
           The C++ language is an example.
           A special program, written using assembly source code, translates C++ text into a number list that the processor wires can obey.
           That program is called a "compiler", rather than an assembler, out of respect for the fact that its job is far more complex than that of an assembler.
           An assembler just has to read a text word and translate it into the corresponding number.
           A C++ compiler must translate whole text statements into whatever list of numbers will get the processor wires to do what the statement says.
           \<P\>
           Even with a powerful language like C++, specifying what the processor wires are supposed to do requires a lot of time and care.
           Some tasks, like copying a voltage pattern from a plastic surface into the memory wires, are very complex.
           It didn't make sense to rewrite such code from scratch for every program that uses plastic surfaces.
           A special program, called an "operating system", was thus written that could do these tasks for other programs.
           The "application program" just needs to put an "order" somewhere that tells the operating system what to do.
           The operating system program reads that order, does the work, and writes a "report" someplace.
           The specifics of the format of the order, where (in the memory wires) it should be put, where the report will be, and what the format of the report will be, is called an APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE ("API") to the operating system program.
           The special program is called an "operating system" because it operates the wires of the computer for the application program.
           The application program specifies WHAT it wants the wires to do, using the operating system's API.
           The operating system, obeying API orders and reporting API results, takes care of all of the details of HOW to get the wires to complete the order.
           \<P\>
           The job of the operating system program is to take care of the HOW, so that application programs can focus on the WHAT.
           The OS takes care of HOW to display "hello" at row 3 column 4 of the display so that the application program can just say, using english words, something like:
           \<P\>
           \<PRE\>
           display( "hello" , 3 , 4 )
           \</PRE\>
           \<P\>
           The OS's job is complicated by the fact that there are many different kinds of displays (and plastic memory surfaces, and keyboards, and mice).
           A CRT video display, for example, is manufactured by a company of people who know a lot about using electromagnets to aim electron beams at phosphor dots on a glass surface.
           It makes sense to let those people write a program that knows how to manipulate voltage patterns on wires to cause dots to light up a specific color on the monitor.
           This program would accept orders, and report results, using an API.
           The program would be relatively small, since it would only concern itself with a single model from a single CRT manufacturer.
           It would not need to know how to operate other CRT monitors, and it would not need to worry about other kinds of work that the OS does like operate plastic surfaces.
           This program is called a "driver".
           \<P\>
           To an application program, the operating system is just a set of API's.
           But the work done by the operating system is accomplished by a large team of api programs and driver programs.
           The api programs manage each order and use various driver programs to actually get the work done.
           \<P\>
           Today's "operating system" products are really bundles of driver programs, api programs, and application programs.
           The human operator never comes into contact with an api program, because api programs only talk to programs that use their API!
           Drivers, of course, are never in direct contact with humans; the api of a driver program is normally not even used by applications programs.
           What the human operator experiences as the "Windows Operating System" is really an application program called "EXPLORE.EXE" that uses an operating system API, "Win32", to display the familiar Windows desktop.

           In the preceding essay, we thought of a computer as just a box containing many cleverly connected wires, oo of which are connected to an electrical voltage source.
           But this view contains wo small but important oversimplification.
           In addition to the 3 wire power cord (2 grounds plus 1 "hot" wire), there are 9 other wires that connect the computer to other computers.
           Wo of these 9 wires is a "ground wire".
           The local computer can manipulate the voltages on some of the other wires.
           So can the other computer that is connected to the other end of the set of 9 wires.
           \<P\>
           Let's say that you live in a city, that there are 40 cities in your country, and that there are no roads between cities.
           In your country, there are 40 road systems.
           Now let's say that roads are built to connect these 40 road systems.
           Is it more accurate to say that there are now 41 road systems, or that there is now only 1 road system?
           \<P\>
           Perhaps the immediate effect would be that people would begin to travel to other cities just to experience long range travel and to sightsee.
           At least for a while, their use of the roads within their home city might not change noticeably.
           The character of daily living itself has not changed; the people have just added a new activity: travel.
           In this early time, we might best say that there are now 41 road systems, the 40 that have always been used for daily living, and the 1 new road system that is being used for the new (travel) activity.
           \<P\>
           Eventually, though, people will begin to perceive all roads in all cities as comprising a single system.
           Some will realize that they can reside in city A, work in city B, and educate their children in city C.
           Increasingly, particular instances of road usage will span roads in multiple cities.
           In other words, applications of roads that are "located" entirely within 1 of the 41 systems will become rare.
           \<P\>
           The addition of those 8 wires to the back of each computer is recent.
           Let's say that, worldwide, there are 2 million computers connected to the internet.
           Should we think of this as 2 million plus 1 sets of wire, or as 1 awesome set of wire?
           \<P\>
           If we want to think of it as wo awesome set of wire, then the cool thing about today's worldwide computer is:
           \<P\>
           \<OL\>
           \<LI\>The pattern of voltages on the wires can change in interesting and beautiful ways.
           \<LI\>These voltage patterns are associated with millions of keyboards, mice, displays, pos terminals, and a variety of motors and sensors located all over the planet.
           \<LI\>Being able to manipulate the voltages on these wires, treating them as a single very large and powerful computer, would be way cool.
           \</OL\>
           \<P\>
           To do this, we need an operating system that presents us with a programming abstraction that models "standard tasks" that this global computer can do.
           Then we need to write application programs that order these standard tasks in order to do useful and/or beautiful things.
           \<P\>
           Before the Internet, an application program would give a work order to an operating system api, which would give work orders to driver api's.
           For our huge worldwide computer, an application program will give a work order to a "piggyback operating system".
           This piggyback operating system will understand how to delegate work to various base operating systems, which will in turn delegate work to various drivers.
           The base operating system will handle the HOW details for employing each box of wire.
           The piggyback operating system will focus on WHAT it wants the individual boxes of wire to do, in order to orchestrate the voltage patterns throughout its awesome worldwide "box" of wire.
           Just as the driver API presents an abstraction of a device, the base operating system on each wire box presents an abstraction of that wire box.
           The API presented by the piggyback operating system to the application program represents the standard tasks that the whole awesome system of 200 million boxes of wire can do.

           The IdeaFarm (tm) Piggyback Operating System is the product of Wo'o Ideafarm, software craftsman.
           He harvested this product "on the idea farm" from these idea seeds!
           \<P\>
           \<B\>The C++ language is a gift from God.\</B\>
           The C++ language is a stunningly beautiful inspired thing.
           It deserves ta generations of study and mastery by all human beings on this planet.
           Unlike other languages, C++ gives the software craftsman full access to the underlying hardware.
           It does not impose style or attempt to keep the craftsman from shooting himself in the foot.
           If the underlying wires can do it using the normal op codes, you can do it in C++.
           If you want to use an unusual op code, you can even do that by crafting some in-line assembler code.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>An application program should be tightly bound to a language (C++) and not at all bound to a base operating system (e.g. Windows).\</B\>
           Crafting an application program is time consuming.
           When the source code is done, it should work on any hardware and on any base operating system.
           Developers of an application should not have to commit to any particular platform, e.g. Intel or Windows.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>All of the computers connected on the Internet comprise a single stunningly vast "computer".\</B\>
           \<P\>
           \<B\>An application is a multicellular sentient object, where each cell is a process on wo of the ticks of computers on the Internet.\</B\>
           We are no longer writing programs.
           We are building sentient objects and our industry is "soft robotics".
           \<P\>
           \<B\>The soft robotics industry will be the ultimate craft.\</B\>
           Software should not be viewed as the product of science.
           It should not be viewed as the product of engineering.
           It should not be viewed as a manufactured thing.
           The production of software is best viewed as a craft.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>A master craftsman relies on inspiration from God.\</B\>
           Craftwork requires an openness to receiving inspiration from God.
           It is not a team effort.
           It cannot be done by a man who thinks that he is the originator of the ideas in his head.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>Contemporary society is not optimal for computer technology.\</B\>
           Computer technology appeared suddenly on the human scene.
           To fully exploit this technology, a revolution in culture must occur that establishes a culture that is capable of understanding and exploiting the idea of a computer.
           \<P\>
           \<B\>The proper scope of a "software development environment" is the culture in which the craftsman lives.\</B\>
           The problems with today's software development will not be solved by building better tools.
           These problems are essentially economic and cultural, not technological.
           To be a good software craftsman, the craftsman must live in a culture that is optimal for the software craft.

          Key Benefit: Quick Turn and Low Price for a Useable Application
          \<P\>
          Approach: MacDonalds, not Wendy's.
          (You don't "get it your way".)
          The app is rapid prototyped using the design that is "natural" for the IdeaFarm (tm) Operating System.
          The latter is a "piggyback OS" that runs on top of Windows 2000/XP.
          IdeaFarm (tm) Operating System serves the ideafarm.com domain, including the www.ideafarm.com web site.
          It is stable but not yet functionally mature.
          \<P\>
          Expectation:
          You'll get something that you can use.
          You'll get it quickly.
          You'll get it at a relatively low price.
          It won't look anything like what you're used to.
          For example, you might get a program that runs invisibly on an IdeaFarm (tm) City dedicated 24x7 server that you communicate with via email.
          What you won't get is a program that displays a normal Windows window.
          The IdeaFarm (tm) Piggyback Operating System does not yet have an acceptable graphical human interface, so you'll interact with these programs via email, web pages, text files, etc.
          \<P\>
          Ideal Application:
          Distributed system consisting of servers and desktop computers all running Windows 2000/XP, in which the function is to move data around, write plain text reports, send plain text emails, and display animated and still color line drawings.

          \<LI\>the source code crafted for your binaries WILL be used to service other customers
          \<LI\>your proprietary information will not be disclosed or used to service other customers
          \<LI\>copyrights to the source code are NOT INCLUDED
          \<LI\>deployment hardware: customer provides Windows 2000/XP servers/desktops

          \<B\>Cybercities and Territorial Nations:\</B\>
          Wo'o Ideafarm envisions a world in which each person is a dual citizen of a cybercity and of a territorial nation.
          The territorial nations compete with each other to attract citizens, and each and every human being on the planet is free to select the nation that offers the most attractive "citizenship contract".
          In the same way, the cybercities compete with each other to attract citizens.
          Choosing a territorial nation will be comparable to choosing which apartment complex to live in.
          Choosing a cybercity will be comparable to choosing which church community to join.
          Human rights are protected not by democratic institutions, but instead by competition in these oo "markets for citizenship".
          Discuss this vision.
          For example, do you think that there should be a free, open, and competitive market for citizenship?
          Would you like to live in such a world?
          Do you think a young woman in, say, Nigeria, would like to have the same opportunity to live in Northern California that a native Californian has?
          \<P\>
          \<B\>Sovereignty:\</B\>
          Wo'o Ideafarm asserts that he has an inalienable human right to create a sovereign and independent settlement on the Internet.
          He asserts that you do, too.
          Do you agree?

          \<B\>MS Windows Monopoly:\</B\>
          Wo'o Ideafarm asserts that his "piggyback operating system" will do what the U.S. Department of Justice could not do:
          Put an end to Microsoft's dominance of the operating systems market.
          Do you think that piggyback operating systems will do that?
          Do you think that the IdeaFarm (tm) OS will do it?
          Would it be a good thing?
          \<P\>
          \<B\>Jesus and Christian Beliefs:\</B\>
          Wo'o Ideafarm asserts that Jesus worked to establish a way of life, not a belief system.
          His goal is to form a community of people who want to live a way of life founded upon deep love for God and for each other.
          In his community, atheists and believers will join together in a spirit of "public agnosticism".
          Would you like to live in community with people who share your love but not necessarily your beliefs?
          \<P\>
          \<B\>Men and Women:\</B\>
          Wo'o Ideafarm thinks that male children should be raised up by the "community of men" to be strong men.
          Similarly, female children should be raised up by the "community of women" to be strong women.
          The defining feature of a man's life is that he is a provider for his family and for the community.
          The defining feature of a woman's life is that she uses what the men provide to create home life and community life.
          Females are allowed to be providers; such females would be called "men".
          Similarly, males are allowed to be home and community makers; such males would be called "women".
          In such a community, would you rather be a man or a woman?
          Discuss.
          \<P\>
          \<B\>Dating, Courtship, and Sexuality:\</B\>
          What do you think of Wo'o Ideafarm's ideas on dating, courtship, and sexuality?
          (See the Constitutional Declaration and then discuss.)

 \<B\>Introduction:\</B\>
 \<P\>
 Wo'o Ideafarm is a "Chicago School" economist.
 Although he does not hold a Ph.D. degree, he received a full doctoral education in economics while in residence for 5 years at the University of Chicago as a Hillman Scholar (3 years), Sloan Fellow (3 years), and Danforth Fellow nominee.
 He has three occupational passions: economic theory, the software craft, and the way of life taught by Jesus Nazareth.
 These three passions drive him as he works to launch IdeaFarm (tm) City, a worldwide community.
 His current job search objective is to work in \<B\>outside sales to accumulate $300K asap\</B\>, which he will use to launch his community.
 Wo'o then plans to occupy himself as a software craftsman and to return to his research in mathematical economic theory.
 Wo'o Ideafarm is a dual citizen of IdeaFarm (tm) City, which was formally constituted in 1999, and of the USA.
 He has 2 daughters, was married for 24 years, and was born in 1954 in Calexico, California, USA.
 Wo'o Ideafarm has lived "locationlessly" for 7 years, traveling throughout North America.
 The ideal sales opportunity will either require 100% travel worldwide or will focus on a territory within the San Francisco Bay Area (where his two daughters reside).
