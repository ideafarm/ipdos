IdeaFarm (tm) City critical asset text files:

This is not a complete set.  But it might be the most critical files to preserve:

    (1) constitutional.declaration.txt
    (2) ideafarm.base.f1.txt

(1) is just an abridgement of (2).  (2) appears to be the source for the entire IDEAFARM.COM web site, as it was in 2003 (the date of the file).  This can be checked against the Wayback Machine archive of the home page of the web site.

These files were never intended to be read by a human.  Software compiles them into a hypertext web site of thousands of pages.

To read the Constitutional Declaration, start at the bottom and place your text cursor at column two.  Read upward, ignoring any lines that do not start in column two.

For a given line that starts in column 2, to "climb up" into more detail, place the cursor at column three and read upwards until you get to the next line that starts in column two.  again, ignore all lines that do not start in the cursored column.

I haven't touched this file since 2003, and probably haven't read the constitutional declaration since 2000.

The constitutional declaration intentionally does not provide for amendments; it is explicitly not amendable.  The idea here is that IdeaFarm (tm) Space has room for all visions, including early flawed incarnations of a particular vision.  If the constitutional declaration is fatally flawed, that is to be remedied by constituting a new city in IdeaFarm (tm) Space that persuades the citizens and residents of IdeaFarm (tm) City to emigrate to its aspiring replacement.

I am including "ideafarm.base.f1.txt" because it appears to contain the source code for the entire web site as it existed in 2003.  This information is of historical value and is irreplaceable.

In both of these documents, you will confront abundant evidence that I am just a little man with a big idea.  Be filled with awe in how such a flawed little man could be used by Higher Power to bring a big idea to humanity.
