COMPUTER SHUTDOWN TAKES 30 SECONDS LONGER
NOT FULLY REMOVED BY WINDOWS UNINSTALLER


**** Known problems (details):
_______________________________________________________________________________

COMPUTER SHUTDOWN TAKES 30 SECONDS LONGER:

IP-DOS (tm) must shutdown before Windows shuts down.  Although IP-DOS (tm)
shutdown requires only eight seconds, for some unknown reason the presence of
IP-DOS (tm) adds from 30 to 45 seconds to the time required for Windows to shut
down.

Who is affected: This will likely irritate you if you are running IP-DOS (tm)
on a laptop or netbook, but not if you are running IP-DOS (tm) on a desktop
computer or on a server.  But it will only affect you if you routinely shut
down Windows rather than use its sleep or hibernate modes.

Workarounds:  (1) Use sleep or hibernate rather than shutdown.  (2) Configure
the IP-DOS (tm) service to run manually rather than be started automatically
when Windows is starting.  (3) Manually stop the IP-DOS (tm) service before
shutting down Windows.

Planned development: This appears to be due to a defect in Windows, so no
changes to IP-DOS (tm) are planned to fix this problem.  Future releases of
IP-DOS (tm) might include features that make it easier to manually stop
IP-DOS (tm) by clicking an icon on the desktop, or to start IP-DOS (tm) on
demand, so that IP-DOS (tm) will not be started unless it is used.

NOT FULLY REMOVED BY WINDOWS UNINSTALLER:

As the old IBM joke goes, this is a "feature", not a "bug".  IP-DOS (tm) is
comprised of two parts: (1) a Windows service, and (2) an "x:\ideafarm.home.1"
directory on nonremovable local storage, typically a hard disk drive.  Windows
Installer only installs, and only knows about, the IP-DOS (tm) service.  The
IP-DOS (tm) home directory is installed by the service, not by Windows
Installer.  When you use Windows (Un)installer to uninstall, the IP-DOS (tm)
home directory will remain on your hard disk drive.

Who is affected: All users who uninstall (remove) IP-DOS (tm).

Warning: The home directory contains all data that you created while using
IP-DOS (tm).

Workarounds: (1) Manually delete the "x:\ideafarm.home.1" directory, but only
if you want to delete your data.

Planned development:  IP-DOS (tm) uses fully automatic, fully unattended silent
updating of its system files and does not use the concept of a "release".  File
updating is done solely according to an internal revision number; no date
associated with the file is used.  IP-DOS (tm) program files are designed to be
"hot updateable"; they can be updated while they are running, usually with no
detectable interruption in service availability.  If the IP-DOS (tm) service is
uninstalled, and then installed at a later time, the newly installed
IP-DOS (tm) service will start the home directory just as if nothing had
happened.  If no home directory can be found, the service will look for a home
directory on a network drive or on a removable drive (such as a USB thumb
drive).  If it finds one, it will copy its system programs (but not its data) 
and attempt to start those programs locally.  This is all working as designed;
no changes are planned.

UNINSTALL (REMOVE)

UNINSTALL (REMOVE):

IP-DOS (tm) consists of two parts:  (1) An IP-DOS (tm) service, and (2) an
"x:\ideafarm.home.1" home directory.  To fully remove, first use Windows to
uninstall IP-DOS (tm).  This will only remove the service.  Then manually
delete the home directory.

Warning: The "x:\ideafarm.home.1" home directory contains all of your data.  Do
not delete it unless you are sure that you want to delete all of your data.
