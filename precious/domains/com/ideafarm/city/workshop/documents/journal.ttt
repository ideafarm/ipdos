!job A: refresh upload archive



  head could be used to obtain the time uploaded, which can be used to decide who did it woth
  this is done only if none exist in the local copy just refreshed
  the key is to upload a file with a name that is guaranteed to be globally unique
  something like this
  ...
   the winning local verifies that it is now alone in the cloud
   all of the losing locals delete their file from the cloud
   if there are multiple such files, the file with the lowest sort order is allowed to retry and the others must wait for 01 tocks
   then resume slave mode, so all such files are downloaded
   notwithstanding slave status, the file is uploaded
   the name is generated in such a way that it is guaranteed to be globally unique (it could include the local ip address)
   dropping a file with a special name into the root of the local folder causes local to assert write access
   configuration is slave (remote is master)

  play with this
    i can eliminate the list and just allow any file name
    this would be a general facility within etherSoilF that could be used by keys other than ktr
    the content of the file is the value
    the name is a subkey
    each file in this folder must be named using a listed name
   alt: add a single subkey to ktr that specifies the name of a folder
  think
   the focus is on putFileS, not on putFileIF
   then I want to rename variables to clean up everything
   then i want to enhance putFileS to accept content value parameters
   the woth step is to eliminate all unused code
  see
   conj: this is pretty much the way that putFileIF is right now: yes and no
  look
   basically, everything that is invariant across pages is presented to putFileIF as text constants
   etherSoilF implements the other oo levels
   the back end software should interface using level re
  think
     the reth level provides complete generality
    re
     the ooth level parameterizes some links and colors, but web sites using this level will still be familiar in their layout
    oo
     all web sites that use this level will be immediately familiar to visitors
     only the identifying text differs
     the woth level is that the format is identical to IDEAFARM.COM pages
    wo
   i want re levels of generality
   i want a simple, elegant way to define that content that is general enough for others to use
    by annotation content i mean the content other than the kt text defined in {body
   right now, all of the annotation content is hardcode

   those differences could be inspected by a new class that arbitrates and corrects
   cloudC could do the comparison but merely list differences
  think
    cloudC currently works with pairs, with one being master
    keep cloudC simple
    i would like this to be built on top of existing cloud functionality
   if possible, i want this to be orthogonal to existing cloudC functionality
  think
   does nothing with file names that are listed as disabled
   if file name is not "disabled", overwrites the vote losers with the winning image
   when not identical, conducts voting to identify the authoritative image
   monitors all
   odd number of containers, local and/or remote

  !subjob C: cloudC: setting to prevent overwriting of different image
    i need to enhance cloudC to optionally suppress overwriting of different image
    corruption upstream will quickly overwrite valid files
   this doesn't really do the job
  think   
      then can upload the changed file
      then must wait for the file to disappear from the verifier
      first, the archive copy must be deleted
      uploading a changed file to the archive will not work
     this can be assisted with IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle
     the only way to update a file is to delete it, percolate, and then add it
    alt: updating is not allowed
   how to update a file
  think
       else overwrite the vote loser
       if 3 distinct images then report
      if C1 != C2 then vote
           L1 -> C2
     C1 -> L1
    scenario: cloud master gets corrupted
       else overwrite the vote loser
       if 3 distinct images then report
      if L1 != L2 then vote
     rule:
           C1 -> L2
     L1 -> C1
    scenario: local master gets corrupted
   consider a cloudC configuration

   if setting is set then copy is done only if not exist in dest
   default behavior is to overwrite different image so that dest is kept same as source

  !subjob C: function similar to diskFixBadFileNamesF that renames to hash
   will need to make it conditional in cloudC::cloudC
   will need to remove the call in 651
   it is called in cloudC::cloudC and also in 651
  think
  look: existing code for preprocessing of names: diskFixBadFileNamesF
   wo advantage is that i could begin to give very descriptive names that use capital letters and blanks
   applications such as putFileIF that want to display descriptive file names would need to look up the file name metadata
   wo issue is that the file names would no longer be informative
   i want to optionally rename all local master files to numeric hash names and to create a special sibling directory containing file name metadata files
   the current code renames local master files to eliminate goofy characters but merely warns about excessive file name length

   rethinking, i have decided to study the current code to see if i can spot a bug that could in a race situation cause the list to be corrupted

   in each minute report, ' ' indicates a grain that is presumed to be available, and '.' indicates a grain that is presumed to be owned at process initialization, either for code or for static data or for the thread 1 stack
    '.': readable and hence presumably in use
    ' ': not readable
   monitor uses this array to set the default code during each tmReportF pass
   declare the resulting array to monitor through TELL and keep it permanently in static storage
   for each grain, set the element according to whether i can read my own memory there
   very early in globals, collect a byteT array semanticaly the same as that used by tmReportF in monitor

  !subjob C: cloudC: rename "congruent" to "copy"
   i just want the hashes compared and, if equal, wo to be deleted
   for this step, i want no copying to be done
   i want orthogonality
   it might be better to use a different syntax
   this will confuse people and lead to configuration errors and lost data
  think
   delete master        no copying is done.  if hashes match then deleted in master
   delete yes           master is copied to slave and if exists in slave not master then delete in slave
   delete no            master is copied to slave but nothing is deleted
  syntax

  conj(ecture): bit offset 7 (or other nonze value) is sometimes being used, causing the wrong bit to be set
   bit appears to really be 0, which means that btrAM is working correctly

    unknown user id's should go to a single "unknown user" id, which is purged periodically but which can be used for testing by people
     exception: the toc will need to have a link for each user that takes the viewer to a page served by the server that hosts that particular user
    heal: from this point onward, no change other than that multiple servers are involved
     this can initially just be a socket connection to factory2, to a new process that listens for such connections
    new step: a new program that "load balances" by hashing user id to select a factory server and then pour each file to that server with a secure socket connection to that server
    factory2 pours to.archive container to local to.archive folder
    use a singe to.archive container to receive

!job C: adam to refresh control.keywords files in archive

    decision: next project is to add bang relay and thoroughly test its robustness by giving it a simple symmetric real time chat capability
    this should wait until after i have added bang relay functionality to bundle
    bang relay can be used for instant refresh alongside of periodic scans
    alt: bundle automatically periodically scans the html box of each other bundle home and maintains a kt that contains far references to the dad of the remote far reference
      accept would result in a far reference being added to the user's kt
      the user would indicate accept or reject
     this would use an enhancement to the kt ssytem to support "proposed reciprocal comment"
    when a comment reference is created, the other user's master copy is informed so that it adds a far reference to the comment
    owner creates far reference to comment on another user's kt branch
    the owner makes changes in a manner similar to how my "toarchive" bat file copies and moves to the 3 hard drives
    the owner's copy of the kt is authoritative
    only the owner of the kt can edit it
    wo kt associated with each user

 next: trigraph to set cBitsExpSlots (also add a member expSlotsMax)
 decision: snap precious and then reduce bits to 4 for expSlots
   so this fact can be used to double the capacity (offApt)
   this requires using EXPsLOTSmIN as base and storing the difference
   i never need more than 4 bits to store expSlots

   the string values are stored (as currently) in jotC instances
   all of this only involves idJot values
   booksC is used for fast disk writes (using memory mapping)
   since the events are sorted in the pool buffer by uri, only wo booksC need exist at any given time
   the final output is a booksC instance for each uri
   the final output is not a pool
   periodically walk the pool to append each new event (as a soulC image) to the file for the uri

   once i have a blockchain storage system, i can play with putting together a communications system and a blob storage system
   once i have infinite storage, then i can play with putting together a blockchain storage system
   woth, i need to add the bang relay system feature and then use it to develop a distributed file system
  think
    as an optimization, a cache subsystem could be developed
   each request for an object would result in the object being reconstructed by applying all transactions
   nothing would be stored externally
   a full data store might be simplest
   do i want to do this as a data store or as a reference-to-data store?
  think
   internally, the state is a sequence of "transactions" on a specified "object"; the current state of the object is obtained by applying all transactions for that object
    the uri references are in the form of e.g. http://foo?length=24242&md5=12345, where 24242 represents length in bytes, and 12345 represents the md5 value of an authentic copy
   internally, each datum is either plain text or a uri reference to an externally stored blob

    with consecutive failure disable, an attacker can interleave valid email addresses, monitored by a bot
   eliminate "consecutive" in specs to close a security hole
  think
   the response page can indicate how much more time to wait
   intentional disabling isn't possible because the malicious user cannot predict who, if anyone, will be allocated the disabled IP address after he disconnects
   the key is that a human registrant will know to immediately confirm, while someone being spammed will not respond at all
  think
   key #6: repeated attempts with same email address while disabled do not affect the period of disability and return a page that tells the registrant how much more time the IP will be disabled
   key #5: repeated consecutive attempts to register the same email address disable for only wo tick
   key #4: expiration disables the IP for wo tick, and a second consecutive expiration for a different email address during the next tick disables the IP for wo hour, and a third consecutive expiration for a different email address during the next hour disables the IP for a day, and a fourth consecutive expiration for a different email address during the next day disables the IP for a strong
   key #3: each registration disables the IP until a confirmation is received or the time to confirm expires
   key #2: a human registrant will never register more than once
   key #1: a human registrant can be required to confirm within a short period of time, such as ten minutes
  think
   confirmation failure is counted for each IP address to detect suspicious IP addresses
   confirmation is required within 1 minute
    later: X could be adjusted dynamically by using the rate of confirmation failure to detect an attack
    later: X could be adjusted dynamically to a multiple of a moving average
    X should be easy to modify so that it can be kept low without preventing legitimate human registrants
    display a response page saying "there are too many unconfirmed registrations pending; please retry in 5 minutes"
   only X unconfirmed registrants are accepted globally per ifc hour
   only 1 unconfirmed registrant is accepted from each IP address per ifc hour (90 min)
   an unconfirmed registrant is only allowed to register himself once
   so an email is only registered once, which results in only 1 confirmation email
    type 2: confirmed respondent is registering same email for an additional person
    type 1: respondent is registering himself

    publish and promote my teachings on gender and sexuality and social darwinism
    publish and promote my teachings in political economics (the Invisible Fist)
    publish and promote my Ph.D. thesis (plutocracy, feudalism)
    launch IdeaFarm (tm) Operations
    launch IPDOS (tm)
    launch Wo'O's Table
   that is a path that can lead me to achieving my objectives
   in a nutshell, administer Wo'O's Table as a volunteer, and develop material for paid public speaking
   this tack feels right
  think
   i can make money by delivering paid speeches and appearances
   this could be framed as launching the IdeaFarm College of Empowerment (Morals plus political economics: the Invisible Fist)
   i can also make money by teaching and by taking on tutoring clients
   for example, i could make money by teaching C++ programming using IPDOS (tm)
   let the moneymaking opportunities come to me, and be ready for them
   approach it as my social life, as a volunteer activity, and as networking
   don't approach this as a moneymaking process
  think
   moderators who charge local dues or require any other form of payment must pay a license fee
   but all other use of the IdeaFarm (tm) trademark requires a submission fee and a license fee
   allow moderators and others to print and distribute the official handout free of charge
   make money by providing services to moderators and to other participants
   do not require moderators to pay anything
  think
    typically, each group will nominate and vote on a moderator, who once elected (via email) will set local dues and commence the dinner meetings
    paid moderation isn't needed until a group is meeting regularly
    to moderate, must pay
    participate for free plus local terms and conditions
   in a nutshell
  think
   only email and zip are required to participate in dinners unless additional requirements, including local dues, are established by each moderator   
   membership in IFO is free until dues are set by board of directors
   moderator organizers must join IFO and also must pay for support from me until IFO takes over support for Wo'O's Table

     failure can be due to length or to invalid characters
    if the rename fails, then the new name is a massaged substring of the string in the meta.currentname file
    for each hit, the data file is copied to the new folder and given the name contained in the associated meta.currentname file
    the search is done using *.currentname file names
    new folder that contains all files that have currentname file names containing that string

I will test your changes in the next few days, possibly today.  But even if the symptom goes away, the defect remains.  Further research has revealed that /Ox is equivalent to /Ob2 /Og /Oi /Ot /Oy and that /Og has been deprecated and "will be removed in a future release".  /Og includes "loop optimization".  It is clear from Microsoft's documentation on /Og that they know that it doesn't work correctly.  We also know from my tests that it doesn't work in a simple test program.  If the test program is compiled within Visual Studio using /Ob2 /Oi /Ot /Oy (omitting /Og), the code is correct.  So, IMO, OWv2 should be migrated away from using /Ox to using /Ob2 /Oi /Ot /Oy.

I have other business to attend to today and tomorrow, but plan to continue to work on this and to send you a pull request.  Feel free to just fix this yourself rather than wait for me, but I should have this pull request to you within a few days.

   see adams containing sa_SSSaND
  next: add code to scan psttName for a regular expression match
     decision: do it
      doing this will eliminate the need to modify the archiveview pages and will be more elegant than requiring some text prefix
      the reg exp can match on 4 digits slash "!ideafarm."
     think
     archive.ideafarm.com/2010/!ideafarm. ...
    alt: specify a regular expression pattern to search for in the url and, if it matches, treat the url as a file name relative to a registered root folder
    it only sees the url requested
    the server does not know its own domain (e.g. archive.ideafarm.com)

 changed: ?
!job B: blammo bundle in production factory5






  walk each directory, tracing file names


  !subjob C: encoding of osTextT file names
  !subjob C: tool to fix nonconformant archive names
  !subjob C: diskWalkCopyF: make my arguments visible to application CBF
  add setting
  set up dut
   can diskFindHomeF be used?: yup
  look
   looks for all local folders of the name ///?/archive, just like diskFindHomeF
   launched by same adam that launches http server
   enabled by setting, similar to http server
  wish
    if it sniffs then i can put it into bundle and it will work without configuration for everyone
   nawwh
   just hardcode the directory names to heal
   kiss this to get started
  think
 playcraft
 objective: elegance
!job C: adam that heals






    rule 3: when 1 and 2 do not apply
    rule 2: normal control file name
    rule 1: normal file name
   craft encode / decode support for archive file names
  think
   some files do not conform
   the heuristics will only be valid for archive files
   heuristics can be used to encode each of these values

    test and study and play, with minimal playcraft to regression fix so that i can see it work
    add bang to bundle
   plan
  think
   perhaps it is time for me to play with migrating all of the code to require ipv6
   my servers have ipv6 addresses
  think
  conj: appr: require ipv6 for ideafarm homes
  conj: ipv6 eliminates the problem
   homes that cannot accept connections use a tunnel provided by homes that can accept connections
   in the same way, each home discovers its external ipv4 address
   each home tests, with the help of a known home, whether it can accept connections
   sorting by time of registration will eliminate network configuration thrashing
  think
   practically all laptop homes will not be serving port 80, so port 80 can be used as an alternative remote port for connections
   starbucks and libraries might restrict the remote port numbers allowed for outgoing connections
   homes will be behind NAT, so will not know their effective (from the outside) ipv4 values
   homes will have firewalls, blocking incoming connections
   if the current code sorts the ip list by value (rather than by timestamp) then the list would be so volatile that homes would spend all of their resources reconfiguring the network
   homes will have transitory ipv4 addresses, assigned to them via wifi routers
  challenges, setting aside the ipv6 issue
    nicNameC has the capacity to store an ipv6 address, but no work has been done to add ipv6 support to the code that manipulates nicNameC instances
   the current code contains untested and incompletely developed support for ipv6
   the current code assumes that every home can accept connections and has a static ipv4 address
   the current code might or might not work

  pending: factory1: robocopy archive1 to freshly formatted e: (formatting in progress 20200408@2122)
 playcraft
 objective: get back to full redundant security with offsite and all healed and freshed
!job A: secure the archive





  !subjob C: play with the idea of cloaking each ipdos home
   conj: this idea could be applied to each ipdos home!
   the ideal application of this functionality would be a directory tree that is temporary, existing only when bundle is running
  think
    when the guardian process is not running, there is no cloaking; the password folder and its contents are fully visible
    the contents can be manipulated by any process that knows the password
    whenever this adam is running, it ensures that there is no child item other than the password folder
   functionality
      this move is done in a way that creates the password directory if needed
     whenever a new file or dir appears as a direct child, it is moved into the password directory
    the adam that opens each folder monitors the folder for changes
    settings: list of [folder,password] pairs
   conj: i should dedicate an adam to providing this functionality
  think  
 playcraft
 objective: security
!subjob C: use a random secret directory name to secure the archive




   appproach: trim one log at a time
  next: incrementally disable auditing until new entries are manageable
  !subjob A: activate windows 10 pro on netbook
   do this for each factory, starting with laptop and then factory1
  think
 playcraft
 objective: security
!subjob A: audit all logins and other events that could reveal intrusion




   next: study the feasibility of reverting that compiler switch by trying to remember why I changed it, or, alternatively, reverting and regression testing
   i do vaguely remember changing that compiler switch for some reason
   by inspection of byteT and sByteT, it is clear that the original design intended byteT to be unsigned and had the compiler swith defaulting "char" to "unsigned char"
  think
 playcraft
 objective: elegance
!job C: typedef byteT: define as unsigned char rather than as char, which is with current compiler switch settings mapping to signed char

  !subjob C: add a CLOAK adam to bundle
   can another process force a file handle to be closed?
    alt: dad process launches locker process synchronously and when the locker process ends, the dad process immediately forces shutdown
    (this can be done by waiting on process termination)
    this other process could force a shutdown if the locker process appears to have gone away
    alt: the process periodically writes an "I'm alive" record to some file or gives a signC instance that another process monitors
   but killing that process can ensure that the incident is documented
   a malicious entity can easily kill its process
   the locking adam can function as a deadman alerter
  think
   but cloaking the home directory would expose the password in ProcessExplorer in the paths for images and handles
   this isn't an issue when cloaking the archive if a file in the archive is only opened momentarily
   wo challenge is to prevent the secret password from appearing within any path that can be viewed

    this will be an exploration, a study of the behavior of the Windows 10 system
    etc etc
    creating files are offlimits
    deleting files are offlimits for them all
    ipdos home folders are offlimits for them all
    what kinds of behavior each image is permitted to do
    which images are allowed to be loaded
   there are oo dimensions
   doing this will make me familiar with what runs on these Windows 10 pro computers and how dynamic the state is
   the initial goal is to secure my factory servers
   this can be fun, as in "playcrafting"
   this will be a good test of IPDOS (tm) because the time that it takes to craft a full shield will reflect the power of the api
  think
    identify changes and report them   
    snapshot drive c (after)
    offline
    update windows
    online
    identify changes from previous month and report them
    snapshot drive c (before)
    offline
   recipe
    appr: monthly update of system in coordination with updating of the whitelist
   it is reasonable to do custom shield for the "ipdos node server"
     ipdos node server
     servers
     enterprise
     consumer
    these are the market segments
   is it reasonable for me to craft a custom whitelist security system?
  think

    cloak blocks access as much as possible and periodically scans protected folders and protected memory to detect unauthorized changes
    the primary means of detecting unauthorized access is the use of wo time passcodes
    when such a shutdown occurs, an administrator with physical access to the computer can boot it disconnected from the Internet, reverse the malicious state change, and remove the malware agent
    this is done primarily by quickly detecting all unauthorized access, identifying the offender, and identifying the malicious state change
    the goal is to detect unauthorized access and respond by immediately shutting down the local computer to minimize malicious state changes
    the goal is not to prevent access
     this includes access to local disks, network shares, and memory
    unlimited administrative access to the local computer cannot be prevented

  !subjob C: deprecate (by renameing) all diskFindFileOrDirF calls that specify *? wildcards
  !subjob C: migrate all diskFindFileOrDirF calls away from specifying *? wildcards
  !subjob C: Cloak: enhance the api to support cMaxFilesP
   so before designing the code enhancement for diskFindFileOrDirF, i should craft that enhancement to Cloak api
   this would cause Cloak to send a soulC image and then begin to accumulate into an ooth soulC
   to eliminate capacity limits, the Cloak api can be enhanced to accept a cFilesMax parameter
   this is the natural implementation given the Cloak api
  think
     when the information for the lath file has been extracted, the handle can be closed, which will have the effect of deleting the soulC instance
     each call will extract the information for wo file
     the handleP parameter can be used to store a pointer to this soulC instance
     the first call will result in a soulC instance being received that contains the information for all files
    if yes, then it gets its information from Cloak and handleP contains the socket connection that is being used for this search
    if no, then it uses its existing code and handleP contains the base os file find handle
    query Cloak to find out whether tFolderP is cloaked
   when diskFindFileOrDirF is called, it can do the following recipe
   after existing code is migrated to take tFolderP rather than tLikeP, its function will map directly to the Cloak api
  think
    each call returns information for wo file
   application calls diskFindFileOrDirF repeatedly for a specific folder until the handle is null
  existing pseudocode for application of:     voidT etherC::diskFindFileOrDirF( tinS& tinP , infoFileS*& pInfoFileP , handleC& handleP , const strokeS* const psttLikeP )
  !subjob C: etherC strIdF: support for revealing the string matches to caller
  !subjob C: etherC support for emulating * and ? wildcards
  !subjob C: diskFindFileOrDirF: study its current wildcard functionality
  !subjob C: diskFindFileOrDirF: take a folder name rather than tLikeP
    getting a clean compile and run will detect any application code that does not conform
   decision: make the change tentatively and regression test build
       but that is not supported by the base os; it is supported within diskFindFileOrDirF
      there is a call that uses ? for the drive letter: ///?/blablabla
     list the calling code that does not just request all files
    conj: all calling code just requests all files (*): 
    i like this idea because it would eliminate the * ? filter wildcards and force application code to use IPDOS regular expressions instead
    this would put the burden on application code to filter for the file names that it wants
   alt: change the functionality to eliminate tLikeP and use tFolderP instead
  think    
   application calls diskFindFileOrDirF repeatedly for a specific folder until the handle is null
  existing pseudocode for application of:     voidT etherC::diskFindFileOrDirF( tinS& tinP , infoFileS*& pInfoFileP , handleC& handleP , const strokeS* const psttLikeP )
   for this job, i need to have a rested, clear mind

  !subjob C: optimize for when pattern is a literal
  edit core old overload to be a thin wrapper for new core overload
  all overloads are coded and unit tested
    conj: yes
   issue: is the trailing / to be specified in the pattern?
  do the root overload
    if i do this, to find a folder i will need to bisect for the dad path and pass the folder short name as pattern
   think
   rename to old
    if no patternC parameter then return everything, querying cloak
    create replacement api's that require folder (not like) and take an optional patternC parameter
    rename all to old
   decision: do it
     these can take a patternC parameter
     there is no way to effectuate a wildcard like pattern
    what to do with the pstt1P list overload and the psttP overload?
   think
   decision: do it
    i just need to be more careful to preserve the exact function
    God!  my instincts are very strong to get this done accoring to original plan
   think
     but do it internally using IFmATCHwILD
     continue to support ms wildcards in the api
    alt: don't edit calling code at all
   think
      else         does this file exist?
      ends with /: does this folder exist?
     no wildcard at all
     * wildcard requesting unlimited contents
     wildcards limiting contents
    cases
   think
    alt: take a flagsP parameter that can be used to say "search for this exact name"
     i don't like it because it makes foreign wildcards part of the api
     this is the most direct way to achieve what i want
    alt: do not do it.  require that the likeP end with either "/" or "/*"
    if i do that, there will be no way to search for a dir
    my plan is to change the semantics so that only a dir can be specified, and all contents are found
    the api searches a long like and finds both files and dirs
   this is a problem
    for example, diskChooseSiteF calls it to look for ///e/ideafarm.home.1/
    if a folder is specified, am i looking for its contents or the folder itself?
   but if I do that, the semantics are ambiguous
   my vision was to eliminate support for file names as parameters
   issue: this api is used to search for both files and dirs

   fixing Elves was a wonderful "hit" yesterday so that now I can feel good about the quality of the Elves program, which has depressed me for 25 years
   yet Bundle takes forever to gen, and process initiation takes too long even when run at command line
   IPDOS (tm) is C++ code, which is at least potentially very close to the metal

    for example, ".*" corresponding to a 01 stroke suffix on psttBig will incorrectly apply a minimum length of 01 to the woth varying, '.': 
   conj: oo varyings next to each other result in min for the woth being miscalculated
   this workaround will enable me to set up a dut to debug ".*" patterns
   osMakeF workaround: '*' rather than ".*"

    when encounter SSSoR, suppress collection until encounter the matching SSSoReND
    obtain snips of cALPHABET1 delimited by any other caste
    scan stroke by stroke
   simple recipe
   nawwh
   the code will be similar to what is found in sssAndF
   a fixed size array, e.g. 01 elements, can be used
   the goal is to obtain an array of osTextT*, each null terminated
   the literals will always be separated by at least wo strokeS
   it only needs to be analyzed wo time to obtain a list of literals
   the pattern is short

  cool ; it works!
  do this
    this must only be done when the patternC (1) is a literal and (2) ends with '/'
    for such patterns, diskFindFileOrDirF just concatenates the path with the pattern and searches for that
   alt: define a "literal" mapping type and a "literal" flag within patternC
    every file and dir within the path folder will be inspected
    when the leaf directory name contains '.', that sets up an optimized closure search
   this is inefficient for oo reasons
   semantically, the new api forces application code to specify a leaf directory as a pattern

 changed: ?
!job B: 102 died

  snap
 playcraft
 objective: incremental migration
!subjob C: deprecate (by renameing) all diskFindFileOrDirF calls that specify *? wildcards

     "a[(hello)([bd]ye)]b"  would match "ahellob" and "abyeb" and "adyeb"
     "a{[(hello)(bye)]}b" would make the same matches and in addition would report the match text (either "hello" or "bye")
     "a[(hello)(bye)]b"  would match "ahellob" and "abyeb"
    examples
   markup and escape sequences so that IPDOS (tm) patterns can be specified using a plain text string
  wish
 playcraft
 objective: elegance
!subjob C: IPDOS (tm) Regular Expressions
  cool ; it works
   this is a way to quickly investigate whether the code works correctly
  think
   each failure would be traced
   the adam would for loop to execute the test for each element of the array
    correct result (e.g. 0 for no match or 1 for match)
    psttBig        (e.g. "1snip.batonc.fooeyF")
    idType of pattern (e.g. "microsoft wildcard")
    pattern text (e.g. "*.signc.*")
   array of struct
  recipe
   a small adam that contains a table of tests, and executes each step and verifies that the expected result is obtained
  wish
 playcraft
 objective: confidence
!subjob C: test adam for pattern matching
  browse code, and then just do this
 playcraft
 objective: simple KISS code
!job C: //U:: MIGRATE flPATTERNc FROM FLAGS TO AN IDtYPE
  cool ; it works!
   factory6 looks virgin enough
   if it isn't tested, it doesn't work
  think
 playcraft
 objective: confidence
!job A: install Windows 10 Pro virgin, and test the repository quick start instructions
  cool ; it works!
   set up dut
  test credentials
 playcraft
 objective: recover from credential compromise and reset
!job A: insert new mailgun credentials into settings files
  cool ; found wo
  clone repo and see whether settings files are included
 playcraft
 changed: ?
!job A: mailgun account disabled because credentials found on internet
  cool ; it works! (not tested on a virgin computer)
 playcraft
 objective: continuous integration testing, user guide information
!job C: ideafarm.work: migrate the needed items from ideafarm.work into ideafarm.home.1 (such as a few cmd files)
  cool ; it works!
  !subjob C: strAndExpressionLengthMinMaxF: create a strOrExpressionLengthMinMaxF function that initially merely evaluates to length range [1,1]
    set up dut to test this
   conj: OR groups can be length other than 1 (nested AND) and can be varying: 
  think
 playcraft
 objective: elegance
!subjob C: strIdOptimizedClosureF: correct handling when OR group is length not 1 or is varying
  cool ; it works!  even with nested OR of varying length
  remove complaining when called for OR group
  rename strAndExpressionLengthMinMaxF
    the motivation for this is the expectation that very little code need be added
   alt: edit strAndExpressionLengthMinMaxF so that it handles both AND and OR groups and detects its mode by inspecting the woth stroke
  think
  create a simple stub function and call it within strAndExpressionLengthMinMaxF
 playcraft
 objective: elegance
!subjob C: strAndExpressionLengthMinMaxF: create a strOrExpressionLengthMinMaxF function that initially merely evaluates to length range [1,1]
  cool ; found wo
  look
 playcraft
 changed: ?
!job B: full build (header refresh) does not refresh ipdos.h
  slash n squeeze dut test dir
  look: study dut
   this drives home the fact that i need to thoroughly test and debug before migrating code to use this
   the current scratch adam, used to craft helper code, surprisingly produces a match failure
  think
 playcraft
 objective: confidence
!subjob A: thoroughly test strIdOptimizedClosureF
  move fileNameC into base
  set up dut
 playcraft
 objective: elegance
!subjob C: helper code to do this concisely

    repeats specifying a range of lengths
    repeats requesting optimization
   when scanning for varying substrings within small, look for these:

   using this information will eliminate most of the length search space
   the big string tells us how long each varying must be
  think
    else report "no match"
    else if every required length is allowed then make a call to determine whether every character is allowed
    if every varying is unrestricted (any character) and every required length is allowed, then we have a match (make a call to obtain side effects)
    inspect each varying to determine whether the required length is allowed
    calculate the required length (possibly multiple alternative values) of each varying
    verify that all fixed can be found, at increasing nonoverlapped locations (remember the location(s) of each)
    obtain a string of strings, where each string is alternating fixed or varying
   recipe
  think
   if it is possible, then the position(s) of each literal string can be used to calculate the [minTry,maxTry] lengths to try for each wildcard string
   this information can be used to quickly calculate whether a match is possible
   each literal string can be searched to record its ze or more positions in the big string
   each wildcard string x can be inspected to calculate the [min,max] length allowed by that wildcard string
   should use terminology such as fixedLength and varying Length
   the terminology should not be literal/wildcard
   wlog, the search pattern is of the form ...axaxax... where a is a literal string and x is a varying length wildcard string (fixed length wildcards are processed as part of a literal
  think
  pf/ add intelligence to strIdOptimizedClosureF so that it does not try search values that by inspection cannot work
  for example, i could seach for the location of each literal and then calculate the length of the intervening strokes to see if that length is allowed by the search limits
  with multiple search strokes, this appears to be searching the entire space, one point at a time, without using information to abort a dimension

   it would be convenient to be able to encode a repeat strokeS so that it has the effect of suppressing the next strokeS   
  think
     optimal search involves trying all possible values for each [repeat,any] pair, including eliminating the pair entirely
     there is no special processing for the [any] occurances; each must match
    recipe for the use of the template
    the template contains an [any] correspinding to each "?"
    the template contains a [repeat,any] pair corresponding to each '*'
    a mapper function inputs a string contining wildcards and outputs a strokeS string containing a "pro forma" search pattern template
   appr
  think
   in a program, code can easily search for optimal closure
   regular expression searches in a user interface cannot easily do searches for optimal closure
   the issue of closure rules is affected by the fact that ipdos regular expressions are programmatic
  think
   the problem is the repeat prefix
   to conduct this match correctly, the application would need to search for ".baton" and then test what preceeds that hit for the prior subexpression
   iow, each subexpression consumes as much as it can and then leaves what remains for the next subexpression to consume
   this search expression can never match because the entire big string will be consumed by the woth subexpression

   for example, consider the search expression:
   but applications need to be able to easily search for optimal closure
   it is good to keep the regular expression processor simple so that it's behavior is consistent and predictable
   the current code simply processes subexpressions left to right and matches maximally before processing the next subexpression

   tentative decision: use a countT* parameter
   alt: do this with a countT* parameter that contains a null terminated list of maximums
   alt: idAdam -001 means max length to try is 001, with -1 being a special value that means to try the largest possible length
  issue: i would like to be able to specify a maximum length to try for each subexpression, too
   another flagsT parameter will specify whether to try ignoring the subexpression
    right to left means that the rightmost pair varies most rapidly
    left to right means that the leftmost pair varies most rapidly
   the function then calls itself recursively for each possible repeat length for each pair, either left to right or right to left
   for each such subexpression, a parameter (perhaps a raw flagsT) specifies whether the optimization is to proceed by maximal or minimal closure
   scans psttSmallP, looking for sc_ccSSSrEPEAT with the special value pair [-1,-1]

   the motive for this job is to prepare to craft some helper functions to make it easy for application code to implement "maximal closure" or "minimal closure" for each "repeat subexpression"
   with the new functionality for sc_ccSSSrEPEAT, such searches can easily be done in application code by trying various repeat counts, in the order preferred, until a match is found
    the first subexpression, "any number of any stroke", will consume the entire big string, leaving nothing for "foo" to match
   this means that it is impossible to search for "any number of any stroke, followed by 'foo'"
   the etherC regular expression search behavior is maximum closure for each subexpression, left to right
   i want to be able to easily support, in an elegant way, left to right closure optimization

   alt: modify diskFindFileOrDirF to contain code that implements * ? wildcards
   alt: provide helper function so that it is easy to migrate code to specify folder rather than like
  think
   i have a lot of code that calls diskFindFileOrDirF with * or ? wildcards in the file name
   FindFirstFile takes a path plus file name, and wildcards are only supported in the file name
   wildcard drive is supported by wo overload of diskFindFileOrDirF and is not relevant to the other overloads

 changed: new code
!subjob B: extraneous char at end of correct file name
   decision: do that (the simpler approach, with no ability to request update)
    for example, cloudC must, after updating contents of a directory, wait for cloak to update its list before starting another cycle
    applications just cannot get up to date list legally and must be designed accordingly
    cloak's view of the folder contents is only updated (randomly) approximately once per hour
   approach: like previous approach but simpler in that requests are not supported
    else cloak's memory of the directory content is updated
    if creation of the new cloak fails, cloak shuts down the system
    at the unpredictable moment, cloak drops the cloak, obtains the list, and immediately creates a new cloak
    validate the request by waiting to see if the claimed requestor flags the request as fraudulent
    randomize the time to make it unpredictable, even if in response to a request
   approach: periodically (on request or once per ifc hour) drop the cloak for just long enough to snapshot the contents of the directory
  think
   cloak gets sharing violation when it tries to walk the cloaked directory
   no can do

 objective: verify feasibility
!subjob C: cloak: feasibility of cloak walking folder that it has cloaked
  nawwh
    perhaps i vaguely remember deciding to retain the trailing \ in order to preserve the information that it is a directory, so that ifFileNameC can correctly render it
    this is because osFileNameC and ifFileNameC currently are inverses of each other
   decision: do not change the functionality of osFileNameC
  think
   i am just tired
   mystery: why can dosOpenIF open d:\tmp when explorer has it opened?
   i changed the behavior of osFileNameC to return "d:\tmp" rather than "d:\tmp\", but that broke the system
   the goal here is to get diskFileExistsF to return the correct answer if pointed to a folder that cannot be opened due to sharing violation
  think

  look
   scalability: imagine the master folder containing a TOCK of adam files
   speed: don't load from all master files when only want to look up a single idAdam
   cloak the master folder
  goals
 playcraft
 objective: elegance, efficiency
!subjob C: redesign masterC to make scalable and avoid walking directory
  snap then eliminate
   eliminating masterC will also promote speed and scalability and prepare for renaming adam modules to include an idOwner in the file name
   my goal now is to determine feasibility of eliminating the use of masterC in order to eliminate walking the master folder (which collides with cloak)
   the masterC code is riddled with these calls

  decision: if cloak dies, trace and shut down (not reboot)

    this would allow dos attack but would prevent corruption of the host
   alt: if cloak dies, shutdown host (no reboot)

  look at hoverC: i dont see such a class
 playcraft
 objective: localize changes to hover
!subjob C: migrate all calls to diskHoverF to use hoverC instance
    but it looks like hiring adams generally will not be broken
    that code will be broken if i cloak those hover locations
    some code does use relative paths
   conj: hovering in the root folder of the home drive will work: yes and no
   but IPDOS (tm) code never uses relative paths to refer to files
   this means that the current disk and current folder are set to a known place
   in the current code design, each process "hovers" in the hover folder
  think
 playcraft
 objective: elegance
!subjob C: feasibility of eliminating "hover" concept so can lock the hover folder
   that way, bundle will install cleanly without the user having to change the "log in as" setting
   this should be disabled by default and enabled by a setting
  think
   the service must run logged in as user for this to work
   cool ; it works!

     run handle in another command prompt
     use Ctrl-S to suspend it
     run handle at a command prompt
    recipe
   conj: handle can be used to inspect the handles that handle opens
  set up dut to try again using osProcessF
   the right way to do this is to call osProcessF
  think
   using system() works at command prompt but not within service
   std out redirection seemed to not have any effect

 objective: verify feasibility
!subjob C: cloak: synchronously hire handle
    alt: combine both: incorporate it provisionally, with instructions on how to install and configure
    alt: require users to install it and configure a setting to specify path of exe file
    alt: incorporate exe file in the precious tree with "do not copy" instructions and instructions on where to download
   on second reading of license, i can do this
  decision: plan B
   licensing is a problem: ms prohibits plan b
   just parsing handle output will be easier and less brittle and possibly faster
  think
   plan B: preserve handle.exe in precious and incorporate its function into base by parsing its output
   if i cannot get that to work, then go to plan B
   plan A: mine the source code to get the code needed to query the object info for each handle
  think
   on factory4, i have successfully called the NtQuerySystemInformation call
   on factory4, i have source code that might give me all of the documentation needed, although the executable fails
   handle.exe works ; i can just launch it and parse its output
  see
 playcraft
 objective: elegance
!subjob C: code to query the name of each handle in the system
    alt: just explicitly use id suffixes for this particular setting
   workaround
   right now, i just need a workaround
   this is going to require some playing with bitTreeC and keyValuePairsC so that I can make the correct design decision
   i am being limited by my poor health and/or exhaustion
   i need to sleep on this
   does this complicate querying?
    ans: etherSoilF can always append an id suffix to the name of each key, which will have the effect of preventing failure on duplication
   so how do we do this "quick and dirty"?
   i am exhausted, perhaps because i am getting sick
    alt: enhance bitTreeC to support multiple datum values for a given name
     this would be programmatically simpler but would need to be optimized to use minimum number of bits
    alt: app uniquifies the name by appending an id suffix
    alt: app passes in an array of countT when processing woth datum for a name and uses that array to store additional values for that name
   conj: multiple values for the same name can be handled by application code
   it looks like bitTreeC cannot handle multiple datum for a given name

   on factory1, do not see any unexpected magic numbers and find only 2 files with incorrect hash values, neither of which are encrypted
  see
   conj: cnr on factory1: yup
   all of the factory1 repositories are migrated completely to format 9 names
   this might be caused by another process renaming a file while the instant process has it memory mapped and is accessing that memory

!job B: 763 760 762 die unexpectedly
   but i am so fucking exhausted, i don't care (and i don't have any specific reason to suspect this other than MS is such a fucked up company
   it is possible that ntfs does not handle this properly and that writing a file to a locked directory screws up the file system
  think
   conj: ntfs queues the directory information and adds it as soon as the lock is gone
   it is a mystery that i can still create a file within a locked directory
   to use this effectively for archive, i must lock all of the immediate subdirectories, because they are guessable
  think
  cool ; it works
  conj: doing a diskWalk will display no files: yup ; it works ; FindFirstFile returns "sharing violation"
   in this sense, the file name becomes a passcode
   when CreateFile is used to open a directory, the files can still be accessed but the dir command displays no files
   cool ; it works!

   | Rush:  Please secure all video recordings for this datacenter beginning yesterday morning and ending with my entry into this room approx 2 hours ago using my access card.  Please secure all access card log entries for the same period.  There is evidence that this was an "inside job", done by someone who has access to the cabinet door codes.  There is evidence that I was targeted and that this was an attempt to seize and/or destroy valuable data, which suggest a conspiracy between a Cogent employee and an outside entity.
   | 
   | For the record, the following items were taken:
   | 
   | 1. Asus Intel I7 laptop, with power supply and mouse transceiver.
   | 2. Power supply to an Asus netbook.  (The netbook with mouse transceiver was turned on last night but not taken.)
   | 3. Two red wireless Logitech mice, containing 3 total rechargeable AA batteries.
   | 
   | What was not taken: Approx. 10 external HDD, nine servers, blue backpack filled with small electronic parts, including three internal SATA HDD (3 TB, 2 TB, 1 TB) and Cat-5 cabling and a 5 port Gigabit Netgear switch including power supply and two multitool stubby screwdrivers and other tools.  The servers were not vandalized; they were operating apparently just as I had left them the previous evening.
   | 
   | Security routine:  I am very careful about security, having grown up in a military town and then working for RAND Corporation when young.  I always make sure that the outside door is secured by testing it before I leave.  I remember doing so last night.  Ditto for the inner security gate.  I always leave both cabinet doors displaying "5 5 5", both immediately after I open the doors and double checked when I lock the doors as I exit.  I have a clear memory of checking both doors yesterday evening as I departed.  This morning, I found the rear door damaged and open and displaying "5 5 6".  I found the front door displaying the correct code, but I do not know whether I opened it or it was already open.  Hopefully the security camera files and door access logs will clarify whether someone entered through the front door of the cabinet, using the code, and then damaged the rear door to make it appear to be forcible entry (an inside job), or whether the only break-in was at the rear door and I am confused about the front door.
   | 
   | Context:  About 4 weeks ago, on two separate attacks separated by about 4 days, my servers were attacked by a ransomware attacker, who successfully penetrated them and succeeded in partially encrypting some valuable data.  This data includes evidence of systemic government corruption within California at the city and county levels.  I have been a full time activist for ten years, and this is widely known within the local government entities that are the subject of this evidence.  For the past 4 weeks, the servers have been offline and I have been working on them to secure them both physically and by removing software and adding redundancy and developing custom security breach detection software.  IOW, while everyone else is "enjoying" a forced COVID-19 vacation from work, I've been desperately working to recover valuable data and to then secure it so that I can bring IDEAFARM.COM back online and resume business development.
   | 
   | Analysis:  The break-in occurred from the back isle, where there does not appear to be a surveillance camera, even though the items 
   | 
   | Conclusion:  This break-in was likely an inside job, done in exchange for a bribe.  The objective was either to obtain or destroy data or to give me a warning.  It was not to steal or vandalize equipment.
   | 
   | Request:  Please investigate this vigorously.  This break-in appears to be a part of a larger effort to shut my business down, to steal my evidence, or to intimidate me.  At this time, I think that nothing significant was lost (other than an old laptop that will be a PITA to replace and configure with software).  But I am in the middle of struggling against a malicious entity that seems intent on keeping me from bringing IDEAFARM.COM online, resuming my business development, and engaging in political and civic activism for the upcoming election.  Any video or door access data that you can preserve and deliver to either me or the police could be very helpful in deterring further attacks on me.

   closing argument (say what I said)
     audio of me trying to give pd notice of speech operation                   5:21     25:37
     audio of pc148 arrest 2 hours later, same officers (reveals true cause)    4:13     20:16
    optional evidence
     my fear of violence and perceived need for freedom of movement is reasonable
     i have been battered and my glasses knocked off at that location on a previous day, with the assailant trying to stomp on my glasses to break them
     i was attacked physically four times by hostile pedestrians and hostile drivers during that speech operation that day
      the Santa Cruz "loitering on median" ordinance, not at issue here, has been held to be unconstitutional
     my method violates no traffic or penal or other law
     i need freedom of movement to avoid hostile and violent pedestrians
     speech is unwelcome; audience is largely hostile and often violent
    testimony
     next: points to make while watching video with judge and officer
    video of citation at issue in this trial (reveals true cause)             14:03     16:03
    video of speech (first minute or two of video made immed after citation)   2:00      2:00
   evidence
      iow, this section must not be construed as an outright prohibition of a speech method
      an incidental momentary stoppage or delay of traffic that is an unavoidable consequence of the speech method is not unnecessary for the purposes of this section
     speech is an incidental use of a street
      not shown that any such stoppage or delaying was unnecessary
      not shown that i stopped or delayed traffic
      not shown that i was in a crosswalk
     the revised complaint cites a section for which no violation has been shown
     the section originally cited has no application except to the operator of a vehicle
     so police cite without knowing what code is being violated
     but i refuse, primarily because i need freedom of movement to avoid violent pedestrians
     pd intends to accomplish this by demanding that i speak from the sidewalk
     pd officers true motive is to silence the speech to eliminate the 911 complaints
     complaints cite safety and violation of law but are intended to silence unwelcome speech
     civic / political speech: unpopular message results in many 911 complaints
     this is a "heckler's veto" incident
    defense theory
     true decisionmaker true cause i refused to speak from the sidewalk
    defense exhibit 2: audio of pc148 arrest 2 hours later
     true decisionmaker true cause i refused to speak from the sidewalk
     hearsay: citing officer did not witness offense
    Defendant's exhibit 1: 14:03 video of 3 officers "team citing" me for the offense in question
   opening argument (say what I am going to say)
    objection: hearsay (citing officer did not witness the offense)  (Officer Terry must provide the testimony or it is hearsay)

!job B: symboltble2 failed grunt
   this code can be rewritted to make it simpler and easier to read
   the use of ad hoc heap can be migrated to heapC
   the use of tls can be migrated to heapC
   the essential idea is to buffer telemetry that is emitted while switching bookC instances
   this code was written before i crafted heapC
  think
    ungrab grabBookNow
       dt scratch and free tls
       pour scratch  (this might ct and use a new scratch book)
      if i allocated scratch
       ct book
       dt book
       increment offBookNow
       allocate from tls and ct scratch book
      if scratch not allocated
      adjust parameters by cbDone      
     else
     else if scratch or no scratching then blammo
     if wrote something but did not exhaust book then break
     write to pBookUse
    while have something to write
    set pBookUse to scratch if exists, or to BOOKnOW otherwise
    grab grabBookNow
   if have something to write
   set flag pool alloc from heap

   for example, full build can be done on any of them, with factory1 being the authoritative repository of ideafarm.home.1

 playcraft
 objective: every factory other than factory2 (Windows Server 2016) are identical
!job A: configure so that ideafarm.home.1/precious propogates to all other servers
!job B: factory1: does not upload to all production containers
  cool ; found wo
  inactivate 101 on factory 2-5 and sameo/cnr?
 playcraft
 changed: new servers
!job B: zapidea.bat does not propogate properly from factory1 to 2-5
  cool ; it works
    factory4 and factory5 are configured to display the Wo'O's Table handout and form
    on factory3, the http server temporary redirects to either factory4.ideafarm.com or factory5.ideafarm.com
    dns points ideafarm.com to factory3.ideafarm.com
   recipe

 playcraft
 objective: scalability
!job C: load balancer architecture
 playcraft
 objective: speed, high uptime
!job A: set up http server to run on a dedicated server such as factory5
    if a file with that name already exists, refuse the registration request
    write the same soul image to that file
    convert nnPeer to a string and use it as a file name
   recipe
  decision: do it
   it is the simplest way to do it, and i only need a provisional solution
   but this would bog down under load due to file io for writing and for searching
   that way, human deletion is required to re-enable an IP
   a simple way to do this would be to create a file for that IP and delete that file when the email is confirmed
   this might be adequate against a ddos, since each node would only get to spam one email address per day
  think
   if an IP suffers a timeout, that IP is disabled for wo day
   each IP is only allowed to have a single unconfirmed registration pending
   unconfirmed registrations contain peer's IP
  recipe
   this will be simple and might prove to be adequate
   alt: only allow wo confirmation failure per hour, system wide
  think
 playcraft
 objective: elegance: simple and effective (provisional)
!job C: enhance forms processing to defend against DDOS attack
  next: set up dut
 playcraft
 objective: simple form taking email address and zip code
!job C: add a form to the home page
  cool ; it works!
   each home needs a mail out function
  launch mail out before http server
 playcraft
 objective: correct function when exist multiple homes
!job C: launch http server only if setting is set
  cool ; it works!
  cool ; found wo
  look: code that processes this
   sameo with both 4 digit serial and with 3 digit serial

!job B: why is mp3 file archived to today's date rather than date in file name?  (audio for my arrest in oakland on 20190427)

!job A: interrupt booking for fucking windows update shit

  set up dut
 playcraft
 objective: no capacity constratints; speed
!job C: 147 -> new adam that will use "book by byte" to sort events by uri hash
  decision: postpone idJotUri lookup by using "book by byte" to incrementally "book by hash"
   temporarily modify 147 to ignore all input events that have already been booked by page
   write a program to inspect every event booked by page (to verify that the image looks valid) (this will be much faster than regenerating all of the books by page
   migrate 147 to use the disk to store the uri by hash lookup
  resp
    i want these to be memory mapped, so perhaps this should be an application of booksC similar to jotC or perhaps even an application of jotC or perhaps an enhancement of jotC
   alt: craft a class that uses a set of files to store values by hash, so that capacity is limited only by disk space
   there are too many uri's to use a switchstack for lookup by hash
  think
   sws_idJotUriByHash

   the allocation failure must only return a null pointer and otherwise not change the state of the poolC instance
   before this can be done, i would want to develop poolC so that allocation failures are graceful (no blammos, no impotence)
  think
   to maximize capacity, each server process would have a fixed number of worker threads who would service connections with clients, and would preallocate
   so each home can launch multiple cells for a list cloud, and multiple homes can do so, and multiple hosts can each have multiple homes that each have multiple cells
   similar to cloudC, multiple processes in each home could be launched to serve a particular list cloud, where the latter means a list dedicated to a particular application, such as access events
   these list server processes could communicate with each other and with clients using bang relay
   but for lists storage, each poolC store can be replicated by launching a new process dedicated to serving each poolC instance
   heap cannot scale since the address space limit is per process
   poolC instances are used both for heap and for lists
   poolC instance is limited by the 32 bit address space

 objective: scalable direct access data store

   whenever the system is genned, all of these files would have to be delleted and rebuilt by passing through the master booksC instance
   this can be made more efficient (reduced file i/o) by buffering using a switch with lever idJot
   rather than use booksC, alt: sequential file
   this is going to involve a huge number of open booksC instances
   the full uri should suffice; i don't need the container or the bucket
   rather than maintain a huge list, let's just maintain a separate booksC instance for each uri
   the reports that I want are mostly for each uri
   divide and conquer

   an enhanced aptC class is needed that is size count04T and contains an aptC value in the low countT and an idPool value in the high countT
   to access the data in the old instance, it must be reloaded
   when allocation fails for a poolC instance, that instance is closed and a new instance is constructed

 objective: speed
!job A: why does field sink take so long?
  edit code to eliminate all tallying
   this is a good opportunity to investigate suspected performance issues with listC
  think
  set up dut
  eliminate the "all" processingr
   the database records can be marked "new" to permit reporting of new traffic
   all of the reporting should be done by a separate adam
   this should just be a data parser that adds records to a database
  think
 playcraft
 objective: elegance, narrow functional scope
!job C: e17: eliminate "all" processing, and feed new data to a persistent database
   conj: this will work even without debugging barryC and booksC
   but most hits will be early in the search
   this design requires lots of sequential memory access as an array is searched sequentially for hash value
   there are no other containers
  this design is simple, it minimizes paging, and it exploits the full countT hash value
     the idJot of the corresponding jot pairs will be equal other than high nibble
     this will reduce paging as the hash values are searched
     oo contains the tally and the string
     wo contains only the hash value
    refinement: use oo jot objects
    hash collisions won't matter because the hash is only used to avoid string compare
    speed isn't important since speed is only an issue when generating the full report, and that can be done asynchronously on an occasional basis
    the vast majority of searches will hit quickly
    this sequential access would be very fast since it is mapped to memory
    the most common uri's will be early in the jot object
    a simple approach would be to just search sequentially for each uri
    then the problem reduces to efficiently being able to find the jot record for a given hash
    when writing the text, leave room at the beginning for the hash and the tally
   alt: store everything in the jot object

  listing (bad code)
   lets see if i can get the code back into working order
   wo possibility is to stay with using sws
   the problem is finding them
   i can store the strings in a jotC instance aok
   the goal is to tally occurances of a large number of strings
   but let's see what i can come up with here
   i am probably going to abandon this job and fix the buggy code

  decision: save this dut as a permanent adam and try another approach not using barryC or booksC
   i should fix that, but fuck i don't want to fix anything
     using barryC in a simple play program craps on nonmonotonic grabbing
    existing code doesn't work
   shit
  think
  set up dut
  do
     if cannot increase bits per field, then reduce bits to index
     if encounter an idJot that is too high to store, then increase bits per field
     hardcode an educated guess as to the optimum values
      bits per field must be large enough to hold the highest idJot value
      to use the full hash, i need bits to index to be 02
     the approach is to iteratively tune myself by adjusting the dimensions of barryC instance (bits to index, bits per field)
    think
   alt: barryC
    nawwh
     use barryC to index hash to woth idJot for that hash
     idJot are assigned sequentially
    think
     pass 2:  find the matching idJot; increment tally
     allocate array of countT accumulators for tallies
     pass 1:  store strings in jotC and obtain maximum idJot; store hash,idJot into hash to jot registry

!job B: nonmonotonic grab
  decison: retain the design but restrict as needed to achieve correct function, such as to eliminate the current nonmonotonic grab problem
   i vaguely remember initially designing for arbitrary name length but then writing code that restricts length
   the current code supports only length 1 pcp names, so I can allocate the required number of countT elements right in bookMarkS
   the current code supports the existence of only wo pageC instance at a time, so only wo bookMarkS instnce is needed for each thread

  change bts btr to enforce byte operand to prevent modifying any other byte than the byte referenced
  decision: do it
   by using byte operands, btr can be limited to modifying the specified byte
   the current code makes it too easy for btr to reset a bit in a byte other than the wo specified
   conj: the culprit is a call to btr

   i have some straight programming craftwork to do!
   i can also set up a dut that exercizes this code so that i can obtain dut results within minutes rather than 1/2 days
   cKeepInactive nonze is not currently supported as this code is unfinished!
   i need to study this code snippet and finish or rewrite it
   the code in booksC::readF is unfinished, as if part of it was intentionally disabled while working on something

   so i haven't broken auto update after all
   collation order is still used for downloads
   the size sorting only is done for uploads
   whoa
  think
   if system shutdown occurs, the executable files can be left in a corrupted state
   but now files are replaced in approximate order of increasing size
   auto update was robust because it would replace the hover files before replacing the master files
  think
 playcraft
!job B: automatic update's assumptions about the order in which files are downloaded is now broken
  cool ; it works!
  test current code, which exponent sorts but does not yet use multiple workers
  decision: do it
    this eliminates the need to sort, and also eliminates capacity constraint
    then process those soul objects smallest to largest
    register each file name into the oo power soul object
    have 02 soulC objects
   i can use oo power sorting
   i do not want to exhaust address space when storing file names
  think
  decision: sort
   so i should assume that sorting is costless
   i am only sorting the files that need to be freshened
   i am not sorting the entire file list
   if sorting is costless then i would definitely sort
  thinnk
     do the small files woth
     keep the pipeline full
    wish
   there are oo goals
   sorting takes lots of time

    rogue binaries could then be uploaded, and these rogue images would propogate via automatic upload

   deletion is a different matter
   that, in turn, will ensure that update never tries to replace a hover file that is being used
   this will ensure that idCopy values are never reused
   i need to ensure that idCopyLath is never lost
   i don't want to "try only once"
  think
   if not exist an exedll.1 cloud pair then launch a cloud pair to automatically update exedll.1 using remote as master
   setting that means 'try only once" when deleting or replacing or adding a file
  plan
   i have edited my settings file to update exedll.1 from the home 101 exedll/1 folder
  think
   exedll.1 must be updated before the ideafarm.bundle.zip file is created
   i don't want to release this in code until my own development computer is configured to keep exedll.1 up to date
  add this cloud to my own spec rather than to hardcode, for testing
  remote: exedll.1
  local: ///ideafarm/ephemeral/domains/com/ideafarm/city/park/exedll/1/
   a setting can be used to suppress this

   the purchase must be real time so that the user does not have to wait more than a minute for his new coins to be in his bucket
   real time feedback is important: the user must say, shit, i've got to buy more coins
   if there is no coin then the service is refused
   a coin is removed from the bucket before each service is rendered
   IFO administration adds coins to buckets
   the home is the only entity that removes coins from its bucket
   each home has a bucket

   temporary change of computer
    (once i have a server, false statements can be detected and traced to the particular key)
    instead, the user states that ipdos will no longer be used on the other computer
    user follows the same procedure but does not make a payment
   hard drive crashes or computer replacement
  wish
   this should unlock IPDOS (tm) on that computer
   the user places that key into a settings pair
   i generate a key for that user and email it to him
   the user pastes that lock id into a plain text email and sends it to me
   the lock id is delivered to the user in a plain text file
   system inspects diskId and email and computer name to generate a "lock id"
   user drops a request for a "lock id"
  idea
   the key can only be used on the computer with that diskId
   the diskId for drive c is used also
   each computer is identified by a name that the user assigns to it

!subjob B: the ooth cloud administrator isn't launched as soon as the woth administrator has attached to the spec napkin
   there is always going to be a general liability risk surcharge of 1/8 for the simple reason that i become a defendant in any suit against the backend vendor
   whenever there is a risk surcharge, the specific risk is stated
    risk surcharge
    passthrough price
    client retainer fee
   re price parts
  think
   i make my money on the client retainer fee
   i charge passthrough prices, period
   keep it simple
  think
   generally, micropayment pricing bears a 1/8 markup, but if this generates risk free net revenue, 
   i make money only on the "membership fee"
   the concept is that everything is given passthrough pricing
  think
     micropayments charged against advance payment to maintain credit balance
      if Rackspace gives me a discount then my price does not change; i pocket the discount
      for example, cloud storage is provided at 1/8 markup over Rackspace pricing
     pricing: fixed monthly subscription plus micropayments to cover marginal cost at 1/8 markup over direct price
     micropayments at marginal cost for all services
     client, not customer
     easy to become client

   use a napkinC to pass parameters to the worker process
  think
   this is the right approach
   but the supervisor process can still hot update, which means that the application can indirectly still hot update
   this approach means that the cloud administration worker processes will not be able to hot update

   tentative choice: alt: use existing support for disabling the handoff mechanism so that multiple instances of an adam can exist for a single home

 playcraft
 objective: clean code, no dead wood
!job C: remove the old handoff code
   now handoff can be used, or not used, as the application sees fit
   now multiple instances of the same adam can exist
   ok
  see
   then all of this can be done late, in the adam def
   the key here is to edit poolC so that poolAdamTemp is unique across multiple instances of the same idAdam
  think
    old needs to be able to acquire state and then to destroy the place
    new needs to be able to put its state and to then die
    old needs to be able to tell new to go away (done, once tmWatchF is watching the handoffS structure)
    old needs to be able to create a place for new to put its state
   here is the basic requirement
  think
   but i do not want this to be slowed down by the need to use the disk
   the old instance sees that it is fired, and creates ...
   this is all in the application code
   another way to do this is to use a persistent napkin
  think
   i want the napkin to be configurable so that it does not exist unless explicitly configured, and can be configured to any size
   the simplest way to do this is to always construct a napkinC that is to be used for handoff data transfer
   i cannot call the adam dll yet because it is not yet dynamically loaded, and cannot be since not exist poolC or etherC
  think
     initialize and retrieve state from the napkin
     wait for he to vanish
     set my osPid into handoffS
     create a napkin (by using a callback)
    else
    if my osPid is in 0 then i'm done
   inspect to calculate the offset that i am to use
  recipe
  look: when does a process know its idAdam value?
   it does not assume that the process is an adam
   a new handoff concept that makes no assumptions about the process and that is effective very early
  wish
   already done: use 2+3 to test functionality; use installer to test for regression
  set up dut
   rewrite the functionality from scratch and then incrementally delete the old handoff code, verifying that the installer and the service work
  approach
   decision: use tmWatchF to poll the handoff napkin
    tmWatchF naps for a tock, and that can be shortened
   the need to hand off can be detected by tmWatchF, or can be detected by a dedicated thread
   just support a callback function that every adam is required to have, that is called whenever handoff is to be done
   let application code do all of the work to transfer state
  approach
   i am also a much more experienced IPDOS craftsman now and can probably come up with a better design
   but i wrote it many years ago and it is both broken and obsoleted by subsequent developments including poolC
   the handoff idea is a good wo
