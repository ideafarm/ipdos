IPDOS (tm) incorporates OpenSSL.  The latter requires the Visual Studio 
runtime.  If IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle fails to start (i.e. if all processes die 
immediately), install the Visual Studio runtime by opening VC_redist.x86.exe .
If your computer is 64 bit, or you aren't sure, also open VC_redist.x64.exe .
