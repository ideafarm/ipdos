RimStar Programmers' Editor

This document was written by Wo'O Ideafarm, who is a registered and paid RimStar user.

All rights to the RimStar Programmers' Editor are still, as far as I know, 
owned by Brian Smith, it's author, or by his heirs.  I have preserved a copy 
within the "precious" directory tree of IdeaFarm (tm) Bundle merely to 
preserve Brian Smith's intellectual property.  Several years ago, I spent a
significant amount of time (several days) trying to locate Mr. Smith and/or
any trace of his software company.  The only legal basis for my decision to 
preserve Mr. Smith's intellectual property is that it appears that the 
property has been abandoned, and that it will be lost to humanity if I do not 
preserve it.

The RimStar Programmers' Editor, although it is not without blemish, is a 
stunningly powerful editor.  I built IPDOS (tm) with it, and I do not think 
that IPDOS (tm) could have been built with any other editor.  Having used 
RimStar for twenty years, I am not familiar with what is available today.  But 
the fact that I have never felt the need to shop for a better editor is a 
testament to its power.  With it, I can get the job done, and quickly.

The main feature of the RimStar editor is that it can load thousands of files 
simultaneously and rapidly search those files, and it is FAST.

If you have any legal connection with the RimStar Programmers' Editor, please 
contact me.  If no one contacts me, I will continue to presume that this 
intellectual property has been abandoned.
