    unzip.exe                   UnZip for NT command line utility, MSVC++ 6.0
    unzipsfx.exe                console mode SFX stub for NT, MSVC++ 6.0
    funzip.exe                  UnZip "filter" utility
    SFXWiz32.exe                GUI mode SFX stub for NT, MSVC++ 6.0
    unzipsfx-gcc.exe            console mode SFX stub for NT, gcc/mingw32
    SFXWiz32-gcc.exe            GUI mode SFX stub for NT, gcc/mingw32


unzip.exe and funzip.exe were compiled with MS Visual C++ 6.0 SP3 (MSC v12.00),
using the win32/Makefile as supplied in the UnZip 5.41 source distribution.
For the sfx stub, the optimization option were changed into "-Oy1"

The alternative unzipsfx-gcc.exe and SFXWiz32-gcc.exe stubs were compiled
by gcc 2.95.2 using the mingw32 environment. These stubs are significantly
smaller, but require the presence of the "crtdll.dll" C runtime DLL.
Normally, this should not be a problem, since this dll is supplied as part
of the operating system core for WinNT/Win2k (at least since version 3.5)
and Windows 95/98. The dll is not supplied in a Win32s environment, but
this should be a minor problem. (For the text-mode stub this is not a
problem at all; Win32s cannot be used to run text-mode applications, anyway.)
